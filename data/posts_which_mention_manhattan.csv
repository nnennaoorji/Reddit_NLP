1,"About mid-August I took a manhattan prep GRE test as got 161 Q. Since then I've worked through the whole 5lb book, repeating sections/problems I did poorly on until I felt I had the concepts down. I took the Power Prep 1 test, and got a 162 Q, missing 3 problems in both quant sections. I felt like I did better both on time and knowing the material (didn't encounter any problems that stumped me, just a few I was unsure about) than my earlier test, but I only managed to improve by 1 point. Even worse, the questions I missed weren't ones I was iffy about, I just made really stupid errors on problems I felt confident about. not sure how to approach this...I feel like I've tapped out the 5lb book, and dumb errors wasn't something I really struggled with during practice. I'm worried I'm going to run out of practice problems before I can get the score I want. else have this issue?

I googled ""GRE AWA structure"" and some webpages gave pretty good tips on how to make stuff logically flow. If you're aware of current events and history then there's a good to fair chance that you'll have content on the fly to fill paragraphs with. the quant section, my brain froze on the last two questions so 170 went out the window 😞. Beware of questions dealing with factorials and powers. the verbal section, I made peace with the fact that there will always be some words and passages that do not make sense in my head, even after the jankiest of elimination tactics.",Done for now - 166Q 161V 4.5AWA,1635608638,7,160,1
1,"Took the GRE yesterday, and the unofficial scores are 170Q and 157V. This subreddit has been very helpful for me, keeping me right on track, and making me switch my decision from the 'At Home GRE' to the 'Test Center based GRE'.  some background, I am from a STEM background from India, so the Quant was not much of an issue, but being a non-native speaker, Verbal was just too hard for me. August, I started researching about what are the requirements for MS applications and came to know about the GRE. Took a diagnostic test, and the projected score was 164Q and 146V. Then in September, I took the GregMat plus and started the one-month plan, but due to internship review periods and online sem exams(DAMN), I could not complete it in a month. So instead I took some extra days but due to my final year project that began around October, I still could not complete it fully. I scheduled my GRE for the 28th of October, and just the night before, I was reading Gregmat's list and watched the Critical Reasoning videos(which was indeed very helpful).  only had some revision to do for the Data Analysis portion, so I did that from the Math review, and then I followed GregMat's plan, doing the exercises mentioned in his plan from the OG, Big book, and Quant Reasoning book. Also, some of GregMat's strategies are gold for solving questions faster, like the 'choosing numbers' strategy, instead of going through the traditional Algebra route, which we are very inclined towards. Later, I only did the Advanced Quant part of the Manhattan 5lb. I was constantly getting 170Q in the PP and PPP tests, and also in the Kaplan and Princeton free tests which I gave later, so I was confident about that part. My advice is, if you are from an Engineering background in India, you can easily score a 170 in Quant. My most feared and dreaded section. I was not very strong in English ever and was only scoring 145-148 (quite consistently XD) in all of my practice tests before starting GregMat. Within one week of starting though, when I took PP1, my score shot up to 151! My first 150! rigorously went through all of his SC and TE videos, solving exercises from the OG, Big Book, and Verbal Reasoning book. I did not follow any third-party test prep, only the official ETS material as suggested by Greg. Towards the end, I went through the Reading videos just 3 days before my test. For vocab, I followed Greg's list and managed to get up to like Group 15 I think (450 words), and that was it. After that, when I gave PP1 again, I got a 160 in Verbal, though I admit I remembered some of the questions. Then I gave PP2 and PPP3 and got 159 and 158 respectively, and I could not believe it myself!   
So all I did was follow GregMat and in a month, my score shot up from a 146 to a 158! Test Scores:  
PP1(Attempt 1): 169Q, 151V Free Test: 170Q, 154V 2): 170Q, 160V 170Q, 159V Review Test 3: 170Q, 155V 169Q, 158V (Very Close to my actual score) Day: a small story before we get into the test. I was assigned a computer with system number 13, and I do not particularly like that number, but once I reached the system, the administrator said that this system was not working, so they shifted me to system number 24. Kobe! I was elated! I took a moment to remember the Mamba mentality and then started my test.

  
The two essays were fine, I had watched Greg's videos and followed his structure, and was able to organize and complete them well within the timeframe. Then, got a QVQVQ.  first Quant section was pretty straightforward and did not cause any trouble. Between the second and third sections, I could not figure out which one was the experimental section, as both had some tricky questions. One question particularly took me like 5-6 minutes to find the answer as I could not figure out any shortcuts to the question. Apart from that, I was making sure to double-check every comparison question as I used to commit silly mistakes in those questions during my practice. Before submitting I just hoped that I had not made any silly mistakes, and seeing 170 made me quite happy! the verbal sections, both the first and second sections worried me. The passages were a bit confusing and had I not seen the Critical Reasoning videos from Greg the night before, I might not have been able to figure out the statement that most strengthens the author's argument XD. I finished the first section with only 3 seconds left on the timer, but the second section was okayish and I had some time left over to review some questions. In both sections, the SE questions were simple and did not have any hard vocab words, and I was easily using the pairing strategy for each of them. As per the TC questions, the two blankers and three blankers were a bit challenging. Overall, as I was submitting, I expected to see a score of about 150-153, but 157 surprised me! was a moment at the test center when everyone's test disconnected due to some server issue, but the administrators were prompt at resolving the issue and helping the students get back to the test at the earliest.  the test was over, the score surprised me very much, especially the Verbal. I proceeded towards selecting the score recipients and spent about 15 minutes there because I only had remembered the University name because, in TOEFL, I was able to find the universities with their names only. Here, I had to search through each state carefully to find my choice of university, and I could not even find two of those to which I intended to send my scores.   
I thank u/gregmat! GregMat plus is literally the best platform for GRE! The techniques that he teaches us, as well as the rigorous practice with his detailed solutions, help you immensely! I am currently watching his TOEFL videos for my TOEFL tomorrow XD. you for reading about my experience!",Done with the GRE - 170Q 157V,1635496590,7,1206,1

1,"Took the test last Friday (22-Oct) and got an unofficial score of 159 for quant. It was QVQVQ. During my prep, I watched a decent amount of material on the math fundamentals required. Had a solid grasp on everything (kinda doubting myself now) and could solve just about any problem that I came across. I didn't really care much about timing (big mistake) cuz I managed to finish all my practice tests well within the stipulated time. I took the 2 PP tests, and about 4 other quant tests, from the OG book, Manhattan, etc. I averaged 169 over all these tests, with 168 for PP1 and 170 for PP2. I have no clue what happened during the test, Q1 was fine. P sure I scored ok. Q2 and especially Q3 were brutal. Didn't have time for about 8 questions in Q3. I just couldn't see the shortcuts. Been thinking about them at home and figured them all out, ofc, but it's the pressure and the time constraints ig.

1,"Hi GRE Takers,  to write one of these, as having read others before taking mine was really helpful and reassuring.  little background- I'm using my GRE as an LSAT Substitute as I'm applying for dual International Policy and JD programs in the U.S.. Last year I'd sat a GRE with minimal studying and  applied to two policy programs. I was accepted to both but decided to wait and reapply under better circumstances. My score last year was (167V, 158Q, 5.5 AWA) with minimal to no studying for most parts. I admittedly was a little ill then and \~*yakked\~* mid-way through a Quantitative section. I was a social sciences major undergrad at a top 5 US uni, so I felt adequately prepared for verbal and essays from that.  I sat my GRE (at home version) starting at 10:30 a.m. and ending around 4 p.m. (I have extended time). It's physically and mentally intensive as staring into a screen hurts your eyes and brain after a while, so I'd recommend pedialyte or a beverage high in electrolytes to stay hydrated. My score was 166V, 165Q, but I might retake aiming to get 168 V and 166Q for a better LSAT Equivalent. 

 I was QVQV and found the math no harder than usual thankfully, but I would say that the problems were remarkably shorter and more tricky mentally for that initial jump; I figured maybe ETS knows people don't exactly have space for elaborate notes on small whiteboards. I felt its diversity of coverage was good and it didn't spend too long on any particular topic for Quant.  was a different story. I found the reading comprehension sections to have gotten a lot easier, but the vocabulary focused sections have changed a lot. I regularly read vocabulary intensive publications like foreign affairs, the New Yorker, and the economist and didn't have a problem last year, so I was maybe a tad overconfident this time. The vocabulary sections feel different in that they're less challenging in terms of logic, but the vocabulary has been postponed to reward those who really put in the time to study. I'd say the value of the test to law schools may diminish if this becomes much easier, but I'm happy that those who put in that rote hard work would be rewarded.  regards to time, as I have 1.5 time, I finished all Verbal sections with 20-25 minutes to spare, but Math I still found myself short on time. The proctor was nice, but decided to start annoying me during my first quantitative section asking me to move my camera around for 2 minutes.  Study Vocabulary. Study mathematical concepts and know them theoretically. Manhattan 5 LB really helpful. Stay hydrated. Stay confident.  to answer any questions and really grateful for this positive community!

I apologize if this post is long. I just had a breakdown during Greg’s coordinate geometry class and i need to vent.  applying for a few MBA programs (Stern and UCLA) and Columbia - Strategic Communications. My GPA is 3.42, which I’m sure is not great, but it’s not horrible - however the 2 classes that really brought my grades down are Quant related so i felt that GRE would help me pull that up a bit.  have been following Greg’s 2 month program. It’s great, i love watching the videos and i even had some fun while doing math this time. I go back to Khan academy for videos when I can’t understand a certain thing, doing Manhattan, logging my errors. Etc. life was good. But now that I’ve reached the part of math I’ve never really done before - coordinate geometry, functions,which will be followed by difficult geometry and data, I’m really struggling.  understand the concepts , at least i think i do, but when people post questions etc on the group and the way everyone has been talking about how wordy and tricky the questions have gotten it just makes me so overwhelmed. 
Most people are from STEM backgrounds and when they talk about how tricky the questions are on their exam it makes me feel like how will i really do it. 
 took me two ish weeks to brush up on things i already knew, and now it’s like I’ve to learn a new language almost. Ideally i would like to give the exam by December. Are there some topics i ahould leave out, some that i should focus on more? Is it too idealistic to aim for a 158+ ? Will colleges look at my verbal more than Quant?

1,"This was my second attempt at GRE and I scored 314 (155V 159Q) in the first attempt. There was a 1.5 months gap between the first and second attempt. The preparation before the first attempt was far greater than the second attempt. I had already completed Manhattan 5LB for Quant and TC, SE and RC and Vocab list from r/gregmat and official ETS Material along with Test-1 to Test-11 of the big book. I thought that I was well equipped with all the concepts and vocab before my first attempt but still couldn't score enough. By this time, I had exhausted all my good study material and could remember the official ETS questions by memory! It was very frustrating I had no idea how to improve my score.  few days after my first attempt, I came across Greg Mat's video where he was reviewing his latest test scores using the ETS diagnostic service. That was very helpful in my further preparation. I started seeing my weak points using the sheet. For example, I realized that most of my quant questions that were incorrect were Geometry or Comparative Question Type in general. I used [ to filter those Questions and I copied the link after filtering to save time and easy access. The concepts were not an issue but there were some time saving techniques in the comments below which started improving my accuracy. Along with that, Greg Mat's question bank is also gold! Each question uses so many GRE concepts in a single question that it feels challenging and fun! For vocab, 900 words of Greg Mat's list along with Magoosh Flashcards (most of the words are common) is enough to know all the words in the test. I did not encounter many unseen words except 'Irenic' and a few others. For verbal, I didn't have much to do, so I read novels like 'Frankenstein', 'To Kill A Mockingbird', 'Sapiens', 'To the Lighthouse', 'Contact' which had a lot of GRE words and felt like a long RC Passage haha. After giving PP1,PP2 and PPP1, I felt the lack of mock tests. So, the last push I made was something many GRE tutors won't approve of, but it helped me. There are many ways to avail practice tests of Princeton and Kaplan for free. I gave 9 mock tests in my last 2 weeks and was able to score 325-330 in most of them. Granted, there were some questions which were very irrelevant to recent GRE pattern and some important ones were nowhere to be found (eg.: GRE this year has a strong focus on Data Analysis/ Statistics questions which were absent in these mock tests) but I practiced these mocks to stay in momentum and gain some confidence. On the D-Day, I used one strategy by Greg Mat which sounds obvious but it really does make a difference. I made it a point to review each question in Quant at least twice. This was possible in the first section and I scored 20/20. I messed up the next section because I didn't have enough time to review all the questions. So, prepare for the test like you have to do the Quant section twice in 30 minutes and you could easily score 165+ in Quant.",GRE Unofficial Score: V159 Q165 [Total: 324](+10 score jump in 1.5 months),1634836053,19,614,1
1,"I took the GRE on 10th October after nearly 3 months of preparation while having to work full time. The testing centre wasn't very good, but I'm glad they did not turn on the air conditioning, as that could have made it much more uncomfortable. What was uncomfortable though, was the keyboards on offer. The keys were very clunky and it made for a very unpleasant experience during the AWA section. Although the Essay topics were straightforward, having to type around 1000 words combined on that horrible keyboard was a nightmare. To make things worse, I found the employees at the testing centre to be quite rude.   of all, I'm happy with my score and I will not be looking to attempt it again. I am very pleased with my verbal scores but not so pleased with the quant score. The quant wasn't really harder. I think it is just that the quant is very simple in the official ETS material, but the Quant questions in the test are not very simple. They are quite simple if you know the concepts though. Considering the fact that I was good with the quant concepts and I found the quant section simple, I have to admit that the 164 that I scored doesn't feel very good. In the test, there were only 2 questions I didn't solve properly, and I knew for sure that I would get them wrong. Accounting for a silly mistake or two, I expected to score 166-167. It is quite likely that I managed to commit a few more silly mistakes, worrying about getting them all correct. This was the case for me during my practice tests too. Way too many silly mistakes.   total, I took 4 practice tests. All official ETS tests - PP1, ETS OG Practice Test 1, ETS OG Practice Test 2, and PP2.  were my practice test scores with the number of questions I got right by section. ]( problem area was the Verbal section, which I identified during the PP1 test I took 1 week into my preparation. I found it hard to manage my time, and I was poor at reading (at least in terms of strategy) and my text completion answers were totally given by the ear. I spent about 2-3 weeks each working specifically on TC and RC skills and strategies, and it was beneficial in the RCs, but only under untimed conditions. As for TC, I understood the strategies, but never actually applied them wholly. This lead to no improvement in the further practice tests. And this lead to a major panic attack 1 week before the GRE when I took the PP2. That's where GregMat's ""The Week before the GRE"" helped me out. I decided to go back to the drawing board and focused only on the basic skills for every type of verbal question - Pairing for SE questions, Support-Contrast for TC questions, Simplifying and Main Idea for RC questions. 1 week before the GRE is when I realized that I had gotten my verbal preparation all wrong. I was measuring my progress in terms of how many questions I got correct instead of how well I was applying the strategies. I began focusing only on the strategies instead of the questions I was getting correct, and I felt I had improved within 1 week, right in time for the actual exam. This helped me approach the Verbal sections with greater confidence, and I was able to complete the sections with 1-2 minutes to spare, which I had never done before. I was even feeling comfortable with the experimental section, which had multiple 3 blank TC questions, and quite a few GRE words in the RC passages.

* 5lb Manhattan for Quantitative Section - Didn't solve 100% in all the chapters
* ETS Official Guide
* ETS Verbal Reasoning Guide
* ETS Quantitative Reasoning Guide
* Articles from The Economist, The New York Times, The New Yorker to improve RC and understand complex sentence structures Mistakes I Made during Preparation Didn't apply verbal strategies completely during practice. My approach towards the verbal section was wrong from the start. Focus only on the strategies and how well you are able to apply them.
* I was probably a bit complacent towards the Quant preparation after I scored 166 on the diagnostic test (PP1), which I took with only a week's preparation. Eventually, I never focused on eliminating the silly mistakes. I knew I could've pushed closer to 170 if  I had focused a bit more. 
* Did not spend enough time towards practice. I could have spent a lot more time practicing quant and just focused on the topics in which I needed fortification.
* I experimented with a new sequence of solving the Quant section, which in hindsight might not have been the wisest move to try out on the test day.  Tips Stay calm and focused during the test. Don't worry about the questions that are going to come up. This could make it harder for you to focus on the question at hand.
* Focus only on the strategies for the Verbal Section, and less on getting them right. As GregMat says, almost take the Verbal Section like a robot. Apply logic and the correct strategy, and don't bother with whether the answer makes sense or not. Trust ETS to have designed the question coherently. 
* Prepare with various test taking strategies during your practice tests. For example,  having a clear picture of whether you want finish the SE questions or the TC questions (or whether you want to solve QC questions or MCQ questions first in the quant section) first could save you time in getting through the section. Overall, it'll help you navigate the section smoothly.  
* Have a good meal before the test so that you don't feel hungry during the test. 
* For anyone working full time and trying to prepare for the GRE, utilize every bit of time available to prepare. Study vocabulary on your commute, or brush up your concepts by watching videos. Read articles that will help you pick up new words. Take as much time as you can before you attempt the GRE. I had reached a point where I couldn't handle the stress of preparation combined with my job for more than 3 months. Even postpone your test if you feel you haven't prepared enough. I'm happy with my score even though this wasn't the score I set out to achieve when I began my preparation. It has been a great journey thanks to GregMat.

The average for the program I'm looking to target states that their average GRE score is ""**&gt;156**"", so with this statement, I'm right under where I would need to be.  question is - what do I need to change regarding studying going forward? I do believe my weakness in Verbal is TC, so I'd like to confirm that once I receive the official score report, but regardless I'm planning to target working on such skills in the upcoming weeks. For Quant, what do you think a 156 signals a lacking in? Would this display a lack in some foundation or merely strategy?  for anyone asking for my opinion with Quant being 'more difficult', I don't think the math required was any different from what you are exposed to in preparation/study. However, the questions themselves were definitely written in a much more convoluted way compared to the ETS materials I used for prep (the Official Guide, ETS Quant Guide), so I'd definitely keep that in mind.","311 (155 V, 156 Q) - Advice for Re-take for 314+",1634819968,14,352,1
1,"Finally done with this (QVQVQ), was my second time. First time I slacked off and did not use official ETS (like not a single one from the books) questions, which led me to get 315 (159Q and 156V). Needless to say I was very disappointed and went through a low for a couple of months. In addition, I did not give any proper ETS mocks either. Only gave PP1, where I got 170 in quant and thought I was ready (Big LOL at that). I also panicked during the test and remember spending like 8 mins on TWO questions which killed my score right there and then.  forward like a year later, I started GregMat+ in the middle of August and started the Two-Month Plan. I also started my job in research so it was tough to juggle those two. I have a pretty good math background (Econ major) so I took the GRE sums for granted last time. The thing is you have to realize that GRE is not really a math test but kind of a logic test so no matter how good you are at Calculus and understand that crap, you need to clear the concepts needed for the GRE. So put aside your ego and get down to GRE concepts from the top to bottom. I had a lot of conceptual lackings regarding primes and the like. It may get frustrating at times but please stick through the concept videos that Greg teaches. retrospect, I should have practiced quant a lot more and given PPPlus mocks too. Additionally, skipping questions is super important and I probably would have gotten 165 Q if I had been a bit more vigilant. mocks I did the Manhattan ones (skipped verbal from Mock 3-6) and PP2 from ETS. 1 :163 Q 162 V     PP2: 164 Q 160 V
Manhattan 2: 161Q 161 V
Manhattan 3: 164 Q 
Manhattan 4: 161 Q
Manhattan 5: 161 Q
Manhattan 6: 164 Q would have paid ETS for not giving me three quant sections as my brain gets fried in the last section, so Idk if the last one was experimental or not but I probably made like 4 mistakes at least there I think. For verbal, I actually did not prep aside from watching Greg's videos because I kind of already knew how to approach the test and I did poorly last time because I panicked. I am an international student but studied under English my whole life so yeah. Last but not the least, shoutout to /u/gregmat . Man is a godsend for providing service at $5 a month.

Scores on mock tests:
PP1  159-162
PP2 158-159
PPP3 160-160 
Considered my scores on the mocks I am pretty enthusiastic about the 163, but I have to say I could have done better. Quant sections were not impossible, even though the second was pretty involving. I was really nervous on the first section and consequently wasted a lot of time doing stupid calculations. I think I’ve done something like 3 or 4 errors on the first quant section. 
I am pretty sure the second section was the fake one, cause it was so convoluted and cryptic. Also, I have faced a lot of 3-blanks hard questions. I am satisfied with my 161, given that I am not a native speaker.  
Pretty much the same difficulty of those you can find on the ETS website. I feel it went good. I hope to get 5  + ADVICES: 
It was not hard as expected. I mean, it was quite similar to PPP3 and almost every question was easy to understand, expecially the quant ones.  1: If you want to get a solid score, you MUST subscribe to GregMat+. This guy is unbelievable. I have no words to describe how grateful I am to Greg, he’s an absolute genius really committed to teach people how to use logic and shortcuts to avoid traps. I understand I only got 161-163, but believe me If I say that thanks to him I have improved my score by more than 11 points in QUANT and 8 in VERBAL. 
I recommend to follow his 2-months guide.  2: get OG, Big Book and Manhattan 5LB and please don’t use Magoosh. 3: PLEASE, RELAX. Trust me if I tell you I could have done better if I was less nervous on the quant. Also, train yourself to skip. One of the mistakes I made was to get stuck on a question I couldn’t solve.  luck everyone! Feel free to ask whatever you want.",GRE TEST 20 OCTOBER 2021,1634747001,5,396,1

- February to September did the Manhattan basic 500 words, GregMat groups 1-24 and Magoosh app all common and half of basic decks.

The verbal is a little off (but not horrible, I thought RCs were decent) on Manhattan which goes without saying but the quant is quite reflective of the current GRE.  one thing that I never see stressed enough is the importance of your mental health and test taking skills. Both go hand in hand. If you walk in thinking you’re gonna fail, you will. It’s a test made to trick you so have a calm and clear mind and think of it as writing any other practice test.

They add different layers compared to the official practice material provided. I think it's becoming closer to Magoosh and Manhattan who are often touted as having pundit questions. I think those ""WTF"" questions on third-party prep companies really help you if you don't have a solid math background to begin. I were to do it again, I would nail the basics of quants using the Big Book (easy questions). Then, I would do the OG tests. I'd probably purchase Manhattan 5LB and Magoosh to drill questions.

1,"Today marks the end of my GRE journey and I'm pretty ecstatic to share my experience! remember joining this sub a month and a half ago and constantly procrastinating and getting nothing done. I even used to question my prep and how it just wasn't enough even after going through all the material at my disposal, but I realize that now, it was all part of the game, the game called GRE prep, so just as u/gregmat rightfully says play the game and don’t overthink it. Being a part of this sub, I've come across the posts about the GRE getting difficult, well that is not the case and sure it has become slightly tricky but nothing that can't be managed with some diligent practice and application of tricks to solve quants and tackle long passages and three blankers. Just make sure that the practice questions you solve are under timed conditions as it’ll benefit you to manage time during the actual test which is of paramount importance. I got a VQVQV and being a non-native English speaker, explains the low verbal score. But don’t let that discourage you as everyone’s circumstance, prep level and temperament is different. Quants was pretty decent, nothing out of the blue but would look unmanageable if you just try to brute force everything. post is also an appreciation post, u/gregmat and tested tutor, you both are godsent, and I just can't emphasize enough of how grateful I'm for having followed your tips throughout my GRE journey😊 is the all the material I went through for my prep: Official Guides (Very Important) Manhattan Prep 5 lb. book OG Big Book Manhattan RC strategy guide Magoosh GRE Vocab Flashcards (Common and Basic) GregMat’s Wordlist Magoosh GRE practice questions GREPrepClub Quant &amp; Verbal Reasoning Questions Gregmat and Tested Tutors videos on YouTube Mock Tests, I took several of them and I highly recommend you take at least 8-10 of them as they’ll help you build the endurance required for an exam like the GRE. These mocks not only prepare you mentally but also physically, and the most important aspect of taking these mocks is to analyze your mistakes after the exam along with maintaining a log book of sorts to list out all your strengths and weaknesses that are hindering you from performing well on the mocks. I would advise that you take as many of the Manhattan prep’s mocks as possible, all 5 mocks from Kaplan as well as the free PowerPrep ones. This goes without saying but I’ll just put it out there, these exams need to be taken in an ideal testing condition and at the time of the day you intend to take your GRE, without any sort of disturbance and should be attempted fully including the essays as one does get exhausted after an hour-long essay section, so it’ll be highly beneficial in building the mindset and endurance required for the test. mock scores varied from 301 to 326, so if anyone says that it is not possible to score well on the GRE due to it being difficult and tricky just based on your mock scores, they’re understanding of the GRE is at best mediocre and they’re low confidence is gonna kill your prep as well, so don’t listen to negative posts regarding the GRE because solid concepts and a decent amount of prep can go a long way in helping you achieve your dream score. key aspect of the prep is keeping yourself in a positive state of mind at all times, because if you let the exam nerves get the best of you, no amount of prep can offset the detrimental effects it will have on your score, so just be positive and believe in your prep and don’t be demotivated if you don’t score well on mocks as nothing, not even the powerprep tests mimic how the exam day is gonna be, so be calm and composed through the duration of your prep and your test and you’ll see it do wonders, I guarantee it! conclude, I would also like to thank all the members of this sub who have been so active in exchanging novel and tricky questions which did help me in ways I couldn’t have imagined before I joined.

I really have no idea what I should do now....and if I plan to give again (only if my recommender advises me so), then how should I strategise to increase my score on verbal. I completed all the 16 sets of quant and verbal on Kmf, i.e. all PP+ and PP1 and 2, Manhattan paid 6 mocks, ~10 free mocks available from many websites. I also completed practicing around 9-10 big book tests for verbal and was scoring pretty decent. Sometimes 7/7 in a long passage. Now, I really kind of ran out of options.

1,"Initially, I just wanted to make this an AMA but I'll start off by listing as many points as I can remember. firstly, I wanna put it out there that I'm satisfied with the scores. I wasn't expecting a verbal score of 160+. Honestly wanted a bit more in quants but, hey, I ain't complaining. about my experience, I had it at the test centre 2 days ago. Arrived there an hour early. Since it was in the afternoon (2pm IST), I woke up early in the morning and was revising some basic AWA templates, going through some vocab, and finally going through ETS's official math review and my notes. after arriving there, some basic instructions were given, we were instructed to memorize the institute codes to which we were gonna send our GRE scores. I highly recommend memorizing these codes beforehand. If you go through the state lists, there are hundreds of universities and you cannot type the name out so you'll have to go through the entire list, searching for your uni. I memorized the codes and then wrote them down on the scratch paper as soon as I sat down so that they were out of my way. get checked thoroughly so make sure you're not too late. They'll ask you your name, date of birth and address to verify. After checking, they take you to the examination room. They'll take a fresh photo of yours there and then check some basic information. This entire process takes about 3/5 minutes. about the actual test, I was taken first out of the batch to the room so I had plenty of time to get used to the environment and relax. I took about 2 minutes to meditate and prepare my mind before starting the exam. best advice I can give you is to not ignore the essays during prep. It's fine if you hold it off till the last week of prep but please have an idea about the kinds of essays, prompts, etc and get adequate practice in. Since essays are the first part of your GRE, if you fuck it up, it'll definitely affect the rest of your exam. essays went smoothly. Now before starting the next part, I was praying as hard as I could for a QVQVQ. And I did get this format! My first quants section was.... not ETS so I'm guessing it was the experimental section. I can only say this in retrospect. So please do not try to guess this during exam, this will make you lax. first verbal section was fairly medium. Something you can see in the official ETS material or the big book, nothing too out of the ordinary. you get a 10 minute break. This break does not feel like a 10 minute break at all. Try to bring something to eat like a banana, an apple or some protein bars. I brought some coffee along as well. Make sure to sanitise before eating and stretch a little before you go back.  you go back to the examination, you go through the same security check again so make sure you have some time set aside for that. Many people don't know that the timer does not start until you click continue on the instructions page. So try to take another minute to relax and calm down whenever you feel like it. second quants section was extremely easy for me. During the exam, I felt like I fucked up bad on the first section and hence got this easy section so I kinda panicked after I was done here. To not lose marks, I concentrated and gave it my best. Took a breather before I started the next verbal section. I'm guessing it was a medium section but the questions were slightly harder with a more complex vocabulary, not too much though. last quants section was slightly harder, I'm guessing I got the hard section? Anyways, it was still doable. thing I struggled with during the examination was time management. During practice tests, I almost always had 5/7 minutes left on the timer after I was done with everything. This did not reflect on my actual exam though, resulting in me just randomly guessing in a few of the questions I couldn't solve on the first try. for mock tests, the highest I scored was a 320 with an average of 318 on tests such as Manhattan prep, Princeton and Kaplan. For ETS powerprep, I scored 315 on PP1 and 316 on PP2.  over cloud nine at the fact that I'm finally done with this hell of a test!

1,"I got this score based on 1 month of studying, using the official Princeton GRE book, and doing lots of practice questions from Varsity Tutor and all the free ones from the Manhattan Review. Sadly, did not know about GregMat till I was too late to make use out of. I spent the day before the exam stress playing mobas. The Varsity tutors were good in that they made it very simple to iron out a tricky subject, but the questions are obviously easier than what you'd find in most other GRE revision stuff. had lots of problems with the Quant section, I think both the papers were Hard or something. I ended up getting caught in a tricky, time consuming question in both sections and ended up having to guess the last 3 questions :(.  advice for people taking the GRE is to be suspicious of seemingly easy questions, always try to study in exam-like conditions, and always do like 10-20 questions on topics you get wrong after every practice exam!","Just got done with GRE, 162V and 159Q for unofficial score.",1633619031,13,189,1

1,"After my [previous attempt (165, 160v, 5 AWA)]( in August, I was pretty hesitant about retaking. Since I'm aiming for MS CS, 325 is a good score but the quants is a bit low. Being an engineering undergrad, getting 165Q felt pretty underwhelming after my first attempt. I think my first section had been experimental, which probably ruined my entire mindset after seeing the difficulty level. I finally decided to go for another attempt at the end of September. I thought I could do better. Ultimately, the score I got was pretty much in line with what I scored in all my mocks-

  
PP1 - 167Q, 162V  
PP2 - 166Q, 162V  
PPPs (Q ranging from 168 - 169, V from 156 - 158)  
OG Book Test 1 - 168Q, 163V  
OG Book Test 2- 170Q, 160V  


 In comparison, the retake had pretty manageable quant (a little harder than PP2, but that's it), which surprisingly left me with 6 - 7 minutes to recheck my work. Verbal was also on par with the PP2, but I had hoped to increase it by a couple points in my second attempt. Anyways, big shoutout to u/gregmat, I binged on his RC and vocab videos, and it improved my speed and accuracy a LOT - I finished verbal in both attempts with 5 to 7 minutes remaining. 

 As for AWA prep, the only thing I referred to were Greg's videos, and his template is really useful and versatile. I read books and write a lot in my free time, but still, as a non-native speaker, I'm pretty darn happy with my score. Although I did not have a subscription, the free content on your Youtube is amazing, man - thank you for doing what you do. Got my diagnostic and I surprisingly scored a +5 bonus (15 correct in the first section, 10 in the second one.) Got a +4 bonus last time, but +5 was definitely not expected xD only other prep I did for my retake was resolving about the first 10 tests from the Big Book, as well as reading comprehension from the GMAT guide. I would recommend doing the latter only if you are out of resources since I had exhausted almost all material available (PPPs, ETS guides, paper-based tests, BB, 5LB x2, all vocab lists.) Although the style is a bit different, they were good practice for logic building. I also solved the entire quants from the GMAT guide (not the data sufficiency part), which had some pretty good sums. Again, I would recommend doing these only if you've covered all official material. I also took TTP's 5-day trial in the week before my exam to solve only the hard quant questions. Their content is pretty affordable, easily organized, and helped me to focus only on my problematic areas (overlapping sets, stats) - plus the timed practice really helped boost my confidence. Thanks a lot, u/Scott_TargetTestPrep! only took 2 Kaplan mocks before my retake just to practice time management (again: try to do all official mocks first, and 3rd party only for timed practice). I found their test to be more similar to the real GRE than other 3rd party mocks (Princeton is too easy; manhattan is too hard and calculation and vocab focused.) Once again, most of my mock scores pretty much aligned with what I got on test day (kaplan test 1: 170q, 160v; test 2: 170q, 157v)), so I'm super happy with my final result. I've been preparing on and off for about 10 months (including long periods where I did no prep, and most of my studying was focused on the last few months.)

I had in fact made a panic post in this subreddit 2 weeks back of how late I could go for taking the GRE lol. I suck at memorization,so it is what it is I guess. took the test at a Centre. It was QVQVQ for me. There has been talk that quant is getting difficult. Luckily enough for me atleast I didn't find that to be the case really. If I had to rate the sections I found the first section and last sections had a couple of tricky questions and left me with only 5-7 minutes of recheck time and the second section easy in quants with almost 15 minutes remaining for checking again. prepped almost everything from Manhattan 5lb. I also saw GregMat's videos for RC. My vocab was good but not great,I probably memorized only 500 words in the end.

Additional to that I just wrote the PP1 and PP2,got no cash for PPP tests. first section was okayish for me. However I felt the second section was really difficult. I had no time left to finish an entire RC,so that's probably organization and planning mistake on my part. TC and SE were also tricky with some words I hadn't seen before appearing. Again of course I didn't memorize enough so that's a bit understandable. Issue essay was a bit unusual so that caught me off guard. Luckily the topic was a broad topic and something I have personally pondered upon in general a lot so I got enough points and examples to write on. essay's prompt had lots of loopholes.

I have been preparing for the GRE for a while (roughly 6 months), however, the preparation has been rather sporadic because I'm also pursuing my undergrad so it is difficult for me to consistently find the time to prepare. far, I have solved the official ETS guides entirely and every problem (verbal &amp; quant) from the Manhattan 5 lbs book.  have given 5 timed practice tests available on the Manhattan Prep website (they're free if you buy the book) and the highest I have every managed to score was on the 4th test - a 321 (160V, 161Q).
My test scores are in the range of 316-321 with almost equal scores on both sections. had also given a timed test (I can't remember which one)  before I started any prep or had even familiarised myself with the type of questions asked on the GRE and I scored a 298 on that test. am looking to apply for the fall 2023 intake, so I can probably afford to give the GRE a couple of months later (Is this a correct thing to assume?) I am extremely worried about scoring below a 330 in the actual test which is actually why I haven't given an attempt yet. I know the GRE score is not the only thing that will determine whether I get an admit or not, but I want to be able to be in the top 5-10% (at least) of test takers if I can help it. only recently discovered this sub and have seen multiple testimonies and success stories for Gregmat's study plan. It is also something that is within my somewhat tight budget. (most other classes in my city charge anywhere from $250-500 for their courses which is why I never even considered enrolling in one) brings me to my main point. I am wondering if it's a good idea for me to follow Gregmat's study plan to try and take my scores to the next level. Having already solved so many problems, the answer seems rather straight-forward, but what I am essentially asking is- is it just beyond my capability to score beyond what I'm currently scoring and enrolling for that plan just won't help me? - Having invested the time in solving all ETS guides + verbal and quant from Manhattan 5lbs, is it still a good idea to enroll for Gregmat's 2 month study plan to get better scores or will it just be redundant at this point? would appreciate any answers/feedback/suggestions.",Looking for some general advice.,1632822138,6,490,1

I really mostly studied Vocab. I was doing okay initially by being able to eliminate a lot of options, but there were still a lot of words that I did not know on the practice tests I did not know, so I decided to focus on that. studying technically started about a year ago, but I didn't really study for most of that time. I would say that my studying time was realistically about a month of solid effort. I have a full time job, so I would say that I averaged probably 90-120 min a day for vocab studying, and then on weekends I would do an extra 2-3 hours of verbal practice tests and writing. studied all the Gregmat Vocab and found a Manhattan 1000 list and tried to learn as many as a I could. I would say in general I didn't know about a third of the words on both lists, and I learned about 90% of the words I didn't know. would strongly recommend watching all of the free tutorial videos from Gregmat for each section. I got a Gregmat plus subscription and I found some of the videos useful aswell, but mostly I used it for the AWA practice, and a few more supplemental tutorial videos. I think for the money it is definitely worth it. for quant, I have a math background so I can't really help there. I didn't feel like I needed to study much as I never struggled doing the math problems. I think if I wanted to improve my quant score I would have just needed to do more practice tests and drill out any mistakes. for the test day, I got VQVQV, which I was somewhat disappointed with, as I find quant relaxing generally. I bent my head over writing on my white board and my head got out of frame, which caused the proctor to ask me to move back. I got somewhat anxious for the last two sections because of this and it definitely affected my timing. I know I got at least one quant problem wrong because of it, and I am sure that it messed up one Verbal question as I was tight on time. I'm pretty sure that under perfect conditions on a retake I could up both scores by one without studying, but for my target universities and degree (computer science), I don't think it is relevant, and my time is better spent on other aspects of the application. free to ask any questions.",GRE 167Q/163V 4.5 AWA - Home Test,1632813830,7,471,1

That is my fault but I also have been working and taking courses so I did not have time nor energy to memorise 800 words. I want to do PhD in Economics so verbal is borderline irrelevant. For quant, I must say, whoever is saying that it is getting harder, is absolutely not telling the truth. I honestly think that Official guide 1-2 and especially Pp2 are very representative to real GRE. I got 169 Q from all of those exams and in my real exam I got 167. But more importantly except one question in the last quant section, I did not see any out of ordinary questions. Even that question wasn't too ridiculous and I could eliminate three answer choices but at the end I made a mistake probably.  obviously did bad in verbal so I am assuming no one would ask any questions on that but I am willing to answer any questions about quant.

1,"Long-time lurker in this sub, thought I would post about my test experience. I got QVQVQ, pretty sure the third quant was experimental. Overall, I thought the quant was quite easy, nothing more difficult then the official ETS books and a bit more difficult than Manhattan 5lb.  think I struggled a bit with the issue essay but did well on the argument essay, the prompt I got was one that Greg went over in one of the Gregmat+ Argument Essay videos so I felt really good about my reasoning.  materials used, I did the Official ETS materials and a *little* Manhattan 5lb quant. I didn't study that much vocabulary, but I would recommend using Greg's vocab sets and it's probably not worth doing much more than that. Most of the words I saw on the test were familiar, or ones that I saw on Greg's lists and recognized but couldn't quite remember the definition, but understood the ""vibe"" of the word enough to make an educated guess. I subscribed to Gregmat+ and his strategies for vocab and explanations for quant (especially prime factorization) were very helpful. His free videos for the essays are gold too, if you don't want to pony up.  last piece of advice is to take it easy the day before your exam. The thing that helped me the most on test day was reappraising the GRE from something I was dreading into something I *wanted* to do, and something I knew I could do. Don't cram the day before your exam. Relax, exercise, watch a movie or TV, spend some time with friends, and don't worry about the test (and get a good night's sleep).  scores:

However, all my time was spent solving Manhattan Prep as my quants were on the weaker side. 2 days before the exam, I completed only half of week 4 quant and that's what dipped my Q score. I'll also attest to Greg's assertion that probability &amp; counting problems are rare as I encountered just 1 on my test. followed Greg's verbal strategies religiously and they should be the bedrock of your verbal preparation.

I wore full sleeve sweatshirt as the test center's ACs were cranked up to max.  got VQVQV and found verbal to be exceptionally hard.

If I felt a question was too hard, I just skipped ahead and focused on RC's as they're time consuming but highly rewarding as well. Pairing strategy helped in 2 questions as well. was neither tricky nor lengthy. I would rate the hardness to be on par with Manhattan Prep.

Started in March, and studied about 2 hours every other day with a 2 month gap in between. Yeah. not a solid strategy. In my first diagnostic, PowerPrep 1, got 157Q and 154V (311). I used Gregmat, Manhattan 5lb, and the three ETS guides. My vocab was mainly from Gregmat's list. I went through Gregmat's 2 month plan until giving up half-way because it was just too intense (for a per-day basis). It took me about 4-6 hours (\~2-3 days) to complete even a day's worth of content and at that point I realized I don't have enough time to go through everything so I just stopped. Gregmat's verbal strategies did not seem to help me. Some of the justifications he gave for his answer explanations made no sense to me, and it seemed like he worked his way back from the answer and not the other way around. Kinda bummed out about this, since apparently his verbal strategies helped out a lot of people. I much preferred an intuitive approach, and while I knew that wouldn't get me far,  I did not care. Test prep was mentally draining and at a certain point in time I just stopped caring. the end of my prep, I was taking mocks and my verbal was stagnant. It did not move AT ALL. scores.]( surprised me about the test is that the vocab was a cakewalk. There were maybe 2 or 3 words I didn't know. Maybe about 5 of the words in Gregmat's list made it to the test. This was oddly surprising. I learnt about 400 words only to not encounter them on the test. But they, that's how standardized tests work. And I'm not complaining. Quants was easy, but due to my on-and-off relationship with the GRE, my time management was bad. I remember guessing answers to 3 of the chart questions, and cursing myself, because Greg emphasized how the chart questions are the questions you should always get right, since they're so easy.  almost cried when I saw my score. With half-hearted prep, I was expecting to get the same scores as my first mock, or even lesser.

1,"First of all I would like to thank people in this community. Posts in this subreddit helped me to direct my efforts in right direction and to solve most of my doubts. coming to my test experience, I gave the test on 10th Aug(sorry I am a bit late to post the experience) in at a test center in India. It was QVQVQ. visited the center few days before the test, made sure of the parking facility. The coordinators at test center were helpful. We were asked to keep with us our passport, any one photo ID, and a copy of appointment letter(even a confirmation email was okay). Water bottles and snacks were to be kept outside the exam room. Pencils and scratch pad was provided.

 To my luck, both of the essays on my test were essays that I had already practised. So I could write those without even giving any extra time to think. quants section was a bit trickier than PP tests and other practice material. Although I am not entirely happy with my quants score being from engineering background, I think 168 is a good considering the level of questions. verbal sections' difficulty was similar to PP test or even Manhattan 5lb for that matter. I knew most of the words on the test. I found couple of three blanks TC questions in second section challenging. I did both the sections well before time and had some time to look over couple questions which helped me avoid some mistakes. suggested by most of the members and even Greg Mat, I started my preparation with *ETS OG* and then jumped to *ETS Verbal Practice* and *ETS Quants Practice.* I was learning words from *Magoosh flashcard app* well before I started serious preparation. I did entire Magoosh stack and even revised it couple of times. for extra practice I did entire *Manhattan 5lb* verbal part. I used to practice 20 questions of each question type a day. And for quants practice I did few question from each chapter from 5lb. would like to mention that I found *Manhattan Verbal Strategies* book very helpful. I wonder why people do not suggest it for strategies. I would highly recommend it. It contains strategies with examples in a clear and concise manner. the end of my preparation I turned to ETS Big Book for extra practice. I found the RC questions quite good. AWA I primarily referred to Greg Mat's Youtube videos. Apart from that I also read some tips and tricks from ETS books and Manhattan Verbal Strategies. I would like to stress on how much practice is important for a good AWA score. I used to pick a prompt randomly from the pool and think of points in 10 min. I also read numerous essays online. from the practice I gave 8 full tests(1 2 test per week in my 6 weeks of preparation) and the scores were pretty close to my actual score.

* Stick to one word list (Magoosh flashcards or Barrons 800). You will always learn extra words while practising.
* For more practice choose any one third party material, as there is not enough question available in ETS material. I would recommend Manhattan 5lb. Make sure you understand the solution for the questions you answered wrong.
* Give as many mock tests as you can. Prefer PP and ETS OG tests. You can use free online essay graders. They are not accurate but you can get a rough estimate.
* For strategies, you can refer to Greg Mat. Use the website's free resources tab, everything is organised there. Additionally you could also use Manhattan Verbal Strategies book.
* Give a mock after 1-2 weeks of preparation and find your weak areas and focus more on them. I was able to reduce time required for RC questions by implementing strategies given in the Manhattan Verbal Strategies book.
* Keep 1 PP for your last week. 
* Write down words that you are finding difficult to remember and go through the list regularly.
* Prepare templates for two essays, it saves a lot of time. All you have to do is think of points and put them in your template.
* Visit the test center few days before the test and make sure you know the route. Keep your passport and any ID with you. Make sure to take a water bottle. Dress in layers so that you can put/take off layers depending on the temperature.","Done and Dusted, Q:168 V:161 AWA:4.5",1632236851,7,946,1
1,"Somewhere around mid-June, one of my friends motivated me to appear for GRE. Not having much idea about it I spent around 10 days getting familiar with the exam. The pattern, syllabus, scoring, resources etc. By June end I had the resources I wanted, alongside with a subscription to GregMat+ (You will feel like I am a GregMat fan, because I am). I had access to all the ETS materials, which includes all the three official guides.

5. Magoosh Vocabulary app. started following GregMat 2 month plan, the only thing I was not following at first was his word list (which I feel was a mistake). I started with Magoosh app for the vocabulary, approximately 20-30 words a day and then all the other videos as per the the GregMat 2 month plan. I honestly feel that while learning for GRE (techniques and theory) you dont need any resource other than GregMat. than that I used 5 lb only for practicing (untimed) on the quants area in which I was weak at first. For last few weeks I was also practicing the questions of the ETS verbal guide (It is the best resource for the verbal questions). My vocabulary was very week and the Magoosh flashcards helped me a lot to improve that. I only did basic and common words from the app. However, later around August second week I started learning from GregMat wordlist. The most useful thing was his ""test your vocabulary"" videos which is available on YouTube. You can't imagine how much you will retain by just listening to his explanation and sentences in which the words are used. last hack for me was full length tests. Its been more than 2 years since I sat on any exam, and it was nearly impossible for me to sit for 3.5-4 hours without getting exhausted. I used to give these tests on the weekends mostly, first few without the essay and once I learned Greg's template for the essays I stopped skipping it.

Dont forget to take your passport, pen/pencil (just in case) and most importantly make a list of 4 colleges (with their GRE codes) somewhere in a piece of paper, after the exam you can use it to easily search the colleges (leave the piece of paper in your bag till the exam is over of course -\_-). experience was very good, to be honest I got more than what I expected.

1,Hey guys!  am sure I’m not the first to be in this position but I’m consistently scoring 163-165 and missing questions that I feel I should have known.  bought the Manhattan 5lb thinking that just doing a large volume of math questions will help me anticipate little tricks enough to get closer to 170.

1,"Hey guys, I gave my GRE today (20th September) at a test center. It was a VQVQV.  center experience: I reached there early and they let me start the test a little earlier than my time slot. My test center experience was not great. After the essays and after my first verbal section, I was so thirsty and wanted to drink water. When I asked the invigilator for water, they said they can't bring water inside and I can drink during my 10 minutes break. I think this is ridiculous, to deny water to someone during a test(in between sections). Also people with other time slots were writing in the same room as me and when I had my verbal section they probably had their AWA, and the keyboard clicks was disturbing.  material: 
Quants: I had a Magoosh subscription in which I started preparing. If you are a beginner in quants or if you've lost touch in math basics, I do recommend Magoosh. Their lessons definitely helped me.

ETS OG. Magoosh flashcards app for vocab
I got to know about this subreddit only about a little over a month ago. Thanks to the community, I was introduced to u/gregmat. I got a gregmat+ subscription (definitely worth it) and started learning the TC/SE strategies and RC strategies. AWA videos in the study plans are great as well. I did a mistake of ""Absorb"" rather than ""Do. Don't absorb."" It just means I watched his videos but didn't practice the strategies enough. I would have ended up scoring more in Verbal if I had practiced more.
Ets OG and Big Book. Don't waste your time solving verbal from anything other than ETS material. tests: 
Magoosh- 310 (152V, 158Q) about 2 weeks before

PP2- 310 (152V, 158Q) 16/09
PPP3- 305 (145V, 160Q) 18/09 felt the PP1 Quants to be on the easier side. I got 3 wrong and ended up getting 166. Idk how.
I was sad after my PP2 score and the PPP3 score broke my confidence for the test. I had never received a verbal score that low and scoring so much 2 days before my actual test scared me. When I reviewed my PPP3, I realised that the first section was actually hard with most questions with a difficulty of 4 or 5. I couldn't pair up words in SE. I told myself, which was difficult, that I won't let this score affect my actual test.  day: Couldn't fall asleep on time because of anxiety about the exam. I slept for about 6 and half hours. Again told myself that I've been to exams in undergrad with 2 hours of sleep, so it should be fine. Didn't prepare anything or revise anything, just went to the test center to give the exam. let your mock test scores demotivate or scare you. All you can do is give your best.

1,"Hello! So this is a late, long delayed post but I figured better late than never.
I am an Indian so personally I struggled quite a bit with bringing my verbal scores to even cross 160s so I'm quite happy here honestly. I could have probably gotten a perfect 170 in Quant but I was quite shaken on the test day so 🙊
A big big thankyou to this subreddit and all the test experience/ materials/ advices given by all test takers❤️ experience:
Honestly, it was quite a good testing experience. The centre was very well regulated. Very oddly strict about security but I guess thats ETS, can't blame the centre
I got VQVQV. Honestly, I didnt really have a preference as to which I would have preferred to be my experimental.
I was quite nervous and jittery throughout the test and the verbal beginning definitely did not help. My first quant section was also a bit weird cuz instead of the normal DI table/chart sort of questions, I got a geometrical area calculation sort of thing, which was quite easy tbh, but I still got weirded by the change in format. During the test, I felt the math questions were quite tricky but after the test, I realised they were actually easy and my nerves were just blocking me.
I honestly couldn't make out which of the Verbal sections was experimental. It had to be either of the first 2, cuz the third one was quite hard. Similar to PP2 hard verbal section. 
I prepped for about 2 months
1. Complete ETS OG
2. Complete ETS verbal+math review
3. 5LB some questions from all sections. Did not touch the advanced quant. Random practice for the verbal sets.
4. Magoosh: Initially for maybe a month, I did it to get familiarised with the question types and verbal
5. u/Gregmat videos for Verbal and AWA
6. Vocab: Barron's essential words + random words from questions here and there
1. PP1 and 2
2. Paper based practice tests on the back side of ETS OG
3. Kaplan
4. Manhattan Prep series
5. Princeton is mentioned perhaps 100s of times in every post in this subreddit, the most accurate representation of the test can be found in the ETS ones. But if you're like me and do not want to buy the PPP tests, I felt the Manhattan Prep ones came second. Kaplan and Princeton are very average. Magoosh ones are trash. 
I got 325 and 328 in my PP1 and 2 so I'd say trust them wholeheartedly. advice: 
1. The MOST MOST important thing is maintaining your calm in the paper
2. Watch Gregmat videos for verbal. Invest in his 5$ subscription, you wont need much else (for verbal). The key for crossing 160 in verbal it to understand what the test taker wants and Gregmat does a wonderful job explaining that.
3. Dont blindly trust and try to implement all of Gregmat's tactics. Watch them and see what actually works for you. People work in all different ways.
4. Vocabulary is super important for TC and SE. But I felt in the harder sections, even vocab didn't help me entirely
5. For quant, practice practice practice. And clarify base concepts. Esp for geometry and algebra+arithmetic
6. Please give the practice mocks in one go with AWA and test-like conditions. It is highly important to build the stamina required for a focused 4 hour long paper.
7. What I realised is to get a near perfect score in Quant, it was essential that I go back and revise all my answers. So try to finish 4-5 mins early so you get to recheck and redo your questions. A lot of my mistakes were insanely stupid, like the 4x6=32 kind. for editing and spelling, posting through the mobile app.

Second Attempt: 161V 164Q 4AWA (9th Sep, VQVQV) mentioned, I am a non native speaker from India and I have never read an actual book in my life. Below is my experience in improving verbal.
Attempt 1: 800-850 retained from Gregs 900
Attempt 2: 1150-1200 retained from Gregs 900 + Barrons 800 used Gregmat’s 900 word list during my first attempt and very soon I realised that it is not enough as I found I knew very few words on the exam. So during my second attempt I learned words from Barrons 800 list as well. This time I knew good 80%+ words from my test (both from greg and barron). I must say that there is luck factor in vocab because in my second attempt I also found high number of gregs words than last time. 
 for second attempt**:
In my first attempt, my diagnostic was:
TC: 4/12
SE: 5/8
RC: 11/20 knew TC was my biggest challenge and also the RC. I started with increasing vocab as mentioned above, but even after a lot of practice (ETS Questions) I was only able to improve a little. Nevertheless I did make some progress after working on:
- Determining support or contrast
- Determining the right clues in the sentences
I made sure while I was practicing I was applying strategies and trying to find faults in my application of those strategies. This helped me answer most of the easy and medium questions however I was still eating shit on the hard ones.  I decided that I need to improve the dreaded RC. To be very honest I was shit scared, I had my test approaching very fast and I was scared if I’ll just waste my time working on my RC and never improve, I always believed RC was my weakest and I was actually satisfied with 11/20 as I was aiming for a 157-158 in my second attempt on verbal.  reading and going through a lot of suggestions I found Manhattan Prep YouTube channel and Manhattan RC Strategy guide. I began my approach by trying to understand the logic behind RC questions and this is exactly what Manhattan Prep YT channel and the Strategy guide talk about. I 100% recommended whoever is working on RC watch “Manhattan Prep Hour” videos on RC and read first couple of pages on their RC Strategy guide. Some of the things I picked up:
- First couple of sentences and the last couple of sentences are the most important in a passage as the deliver the central idea.
- 70% of the information on passage is literally useless, you only need the important bits that progress the central idea of the passage 
- It is easy to understand authors stance by looking at the type of evidences they provide and claims they makes
- No outside knowledge, strictly
- No over simplification of central Idea
- No diving into specifics of one part of passage with regard to central Idea 
- Central Idea is everything
- Each option under the question must by justified using evidence from passage
These are few of the things I realised after my “quest” to Hack the RCs. Then I started my practice, surprisingly enough, I was barely making mistakes! I also focused on what way better suites me while reading passage. For me it was:
- Reading slow and grasping the important bits of passage and just remembering the location of bits that might be complicated and when there was a question related to a specific bit, go back and read that bit with central Idea still in mind
It took me less than a week to improve my RC. I should also mention that first I was struggling with complex sentence structures in RC (due to being non native speaker) so I bought a subscription of NYT and read an article daily which improved my reading speed and understanding of sentence structures. SE, since I increased my vocab, with a little practice I was able to pair up words pretty well and was doing good overall. to note, on the verbal prep, I only spent about 2 weeks or less with average of 1-2hrs a day since I work full time + college. So for me this was a huge improvement the other hand, Quant. I puked all over it so let’s not talk about that xD maybe I’ll give GRE a third time because this battle between me and GRE in a way has turned personal and it feels like I need to defeat it or get haunted by it for rest of my life.

I was scoring above 320 during final weeks of prep including PPPlus. I ended up  getting really low marks. am confused, what to do now, not what happed?

1,"  my journey of how I scored 331/340 in my GRE.  
Verbal - 162/170  
Quant - 169/170 - The difficulty level of Quant has drastically increased since the last time I took GRE which was in 2020. I think I could have performed better at Verbal but my last section had 1 single and double blank and 4 triple blank questions which really threw me off. Nonetheless, I am really satisfied with my score.   studied Political Science in undergraduate, I was under the impression that Verbal would be relatively easier for me as I took writing-intensive coursework in colllege. However, that preconceived notion was called into question when I first appeared for GRE in August 2020 when I scored 306/340. I only practiced through  Manhattan practice tests and did not work on my concepts which resulted in such a score.  
Verbal - 152/170  
Quant - 154/170 Quant -  I started my preparation from scratch as I worked on my math concepts from the Manhattan Guides. After which, I solved the quant questions from the Manhattan 5lb book. I then got a 3-month subscription from ScholarDen where I practiced the quant questions. I must say that Scholarden perfectly mimics the difficult questions that one will witness in the actual GRE.  I first went with the easy questions, followed by medium, and hard questions. I had an error log where I jotted down the incorrect questions that I had from the Manhattan 5lb book and ScholarDen questions. I used to go back to those questions and work on my weaker areas. After doing all this, I practiced full-length tests.  Verbal - I purchased a yearly New York Times subscription as I used to read 4 articles every day spanning from topics such as technology, literature, and politics. I also read articles from Long Reads - a very good resource. Following which I started practicing Reading Comprehension on ReadTheory until I reached level 12. Watching the verbal videos from ScholarDen also helped me a lot regarding exam-taking strategies. While I was doing this, I was also doing words from the Magoosh App, I managed to do all the basic, common, and advanced words from the App whenever I got time. I then went on to practice Verbal from the ETS Big Book. After doing preparation from all of the resources, I moved on to doing full-length practice tests.  conclusion, it has been an uphill battle for me as I am a working professional so finding out time after work while living all by myself and doing household chores was difficult. Nevertheless, I managed as I was adamant to go for my Masters at a really good university. As cliched as it sounds, do not give up and keep on trying and hopefully, you will see the desired results.","Sharing my journey of, how I scored 331/340 in my GRE?",1631938480,13,505,1

I followed his 2 months study plan for verbal and watched all his videos in 2x. used most of his strategies in the exam - - Math strategy (This is used in almost 80% of the questions), block of 4 ( Also used in RC inference questions) - Pairing strategy. One other thing I followed was that while I was preparing for Vocab, I always made sure to google and check out the synonyms. For example, when you google obsequious, you'll find sycophantic, grovelling, unctuous, fawning etc in the list) Try to learn them together. I actual got a obsequious, sycophantic pair in the test. - Start by trying to understand the passage. A lot of the themes were new to me. Big book is a great  resource. Also, try to google about the common themes talked about in the passages. You'll find a lot about literature during periods like Renaissance, Romanticism, The Middle Ages etc etc. Understanding these periods will help you understand the passage better. You'll also find a lot of passages about planets, women literature related to their struggle for right to vote, literature related to abolishing of slavery. Go to wikipedia and understand the context and the time period. This will help you a great great deal. at the test centre: my system shut down during the 7th minute of V2. Luckily for me, the staffs acted quickly and I was able to continue the test without any loss of time (I was panicking but the GRE can start off from where you left in case of a technical issue or a system shut down) with the actual test:** quant section was very very similar to the power prep plus (1,2,3) questions. I got some questions on standard deviation and statistics which were directly from the power prep plus tests (some concepts) got QVQVQ in which the second Q was tougher than the final one. I wasn't sure about the experimental section, so I was really careful even in the final Q section. second section was time consuming with a lot of lengthy multiple options questions. I had to guess a couple of questions in the end. the rest of the sections in quant, I had 5 minutes to recheck the questions in the end. (Always do this if you have extra time. I had made an error which I was able to find out during rechecking) If you are solving problems algebraically, write down the type of the variables with some examples. I always do this because this is one of the ways that GRE tricks you. For eg, if it is given that x is a non-negative integer, I always write it down followed by x = 0,1,2,3...... infinity  in brackets. did not go as planned. One of the passages was really hard to understand and I panicked. My time management was poor and I had to guess at least 3 questions in the end. was fairly easy (I think this was as a result of my performance in V1) didn't encounter any new words. ( I only used greg's list and Magoosh's app for Vocab preparation) I think preparing from the big book helped me a lot. The questions were similar and the big book has a lot of questions to practice strategies ( It has more to do with your logical skill than your English skills. Greg's Math strategy and block of 4 were useful) Just use Greg's pairing strategy. It is hard to get this wrong if you use the strategy right.

Prep time: 2.5 Months I will try and add as many details as possible and answer most of the usual questions. the background suggests, being a MechE undergraduate, had a fairly firm grip on Quants while Verbal had some work to do, being a non-native speaker. Quant: Finished solving the entire Manhattan 5Lb book for Quant by following Greg's 2 Month Plan. After that, I had a look through ETS Quant Guide and Official Guide. That honestly was pretty much it from the preparation stage. I mostly made ""silly"" errors, and my focus was to be aware to eliminate those from occurring.  the last 10-15 days of my prep, I looked over Advanced Quant (as suggested here by a few folks) and also solved Greg's Quant Problem solving. That according to me was enough practice. Verbal: This was the key challenge, since my TC and RC was in absolute shambles in the diagnostic. I followed Greg's 2 month plan for Verbal as well, and trust me it does wonders. He made TC look so easy and just about understanding the logic. For TC, just follow the ""various tools in the toolkit"" and you'll be good to go. Pairing Strategy for SE is just perfect. With just the right grasp of vocab, the pairing strategy is bound to reap rewards (99% of the times). As far as RCs are concerned, never my strong point even in the actual GRE, I lost a lot in the RCs. My suggestion would be solve the Big Book as much as possible since the RCs are almost of the same level as what appears on the actual GRE. Thankfully, didn't get those CR buggers in my GRE. Greg's 30 word lists and it was more than enough. I did them with 3-4 synonyms for each word, so had a pretty jacked up vocab arsenal. AWA: Never touched this in the 2 month prep.

2. Magoosh 1 month subscription for Verbal practice and taking mocks.
3. Greg's YouTube videos for Verbal strategies and Greg's Word List (Very important resources, gave a significant score boost). Personally, I didn't go with the Gregmat+ subscription (Greg, if you are reading this, you are really great. I can't deny on how useful your YouTube video strategies were) I had taken a few mocks: Magoosh, Manhattan Prep, Princeton Review. My Quant was really good with certain room for improvement (I wanted to score a perfect 170, and I used to score 165+ in the mocks), but my Verbal sucked. I scored in the range of 140-150.  PP1 exactly a week before the test, scored 314 (Q166 V148)  started analyzing all these tests. For Verbal, I realized  I was more confident in RC questions and therefore, I decided to attend all the RC questions first taking about 18 - 20 mins, then moved on to the rest of the section. I saw a nice score boost in Verbal Practice by doing this, so I kept following this strategy. It was along this time, I was also looking into Greg's word list. By far, the most useful resource I had come across, all thanks to this subreddit. PP2 the day before the exam, scored 316 (Q162 V154): I got over 150 in Verbal which boosted my confidence for the next day. I was also confident of scoring 170 in Quant after this test. Day: My test was scheduled at 12:30 PM. Reached the Prometric testing center early. Finished all the security checks. One of the main instructions was to not remove the face mask anytime during the test. I understand, this rule was common for everybody, but I couldn't breathe properly in the mask for some reason during the test. I had to spend a lot of time adjusting it, and couldn't focus on the writing section and the first Quant section (order was QVQVQ). Things got a little better when I went out for the break to get a bit of air. I came back, revitalized and attempted the remaining sections. In the end, reported the scores and was relieved when I saw a score of 320. Overall I was moderately satisfied. I was expecting 170 in Quant, but 168 is also not that bad. 152 in Verbal is also quite satisfactory for me. I might consider retaking the test if I don't get into the programs I am aiming at.  GRE (or any test for that matter), is a good game. Identify and play it according to your strengths.

1,"Hey y’all, I’m finally done with the GRE so I thought I would do a write-up. I’ve spent a lot of time perusing these forums during my preparation so I wanted to give back in some way, hope it’s helpful. details: Q164, V165, not sure yet about essay because I took it today. 
Previous attempt (August 12th): Q159, V164, Essay 5.5 In person at testing center. I thought the test center procedure was very smooth, had to wear mask whole time. If possible, I would definitely advise taking it at the center because it’s much easier to focus in a controlled environment, no distractions, don’t have to worry about wifi, etc. For me that peace of mind far outweighed the potential convenience of taking it at home.  timeline: About 3 months. I started seriously studying in June. I have a full time corporate job that is pretty demanding so I wanted to make sure I spaced out my study time. Bulk of studying occurred on weekends and maybe 1 or 2 hours during weekdays.  materials: ETS Quant Guide, Manhattan Review free practice test, Kaplan free practice test, PP1, PP2, PP3, 5lb book. I didn’t sign up for a specific training course, but I watched a lot of Gregmat youtube videos and spent time doing self study on youtube in general on topics I was weak in. I love the exam walkthroughs by Gregmat. More than the actual questions, it was really helpful and reassuring to gain some tips on how to approach test day. For vocab, I used manhattan prep 1000 words pdf thats free and found on google. I didn’t focus much on verbal section because it’s my strong suit, my practice was just via the full length practice tests. I did think the argument evaluation section for verbal in the 5lb book was really helpful since that type of question I struggled with a bit. For essay prep, I reviewed the ETS essay guide / samples and reviewed a few sample prompts to get into the habit of thinking how I would structure my essay come test day.  I thought the exam was quite comparable to PP3. The first time I took the exam I only purchased PP1, and I think having more full length practice tests under my belt this time helped me. Honestly I really struggle with test taking in general, I have a lot of anxiety and sometimes it feels like my mind just goes totally blank. I am also not really a math person. To combat this, I started my quant with the graphs section since I find those easier and it helped me warm up and feel more confident. Also, definitely realize when it is time to skip a question!!! I made this mistake the first time and totally screwed up my timings. I’m not sure if any of you watch the show Ted Lasso but Coach Ted says as athletes they should have memories of a goldfish aka forget bad moments/errors quickly. I think that can be applied to test taking as well. If I didn’t feel that great about a question I would actively force myself to just purge it, quick mental reset and go all in on the next question. For me these attitude changes helped a lot in improving quant score.  also think focusing on perfecting my understanding of the key concepts was critical versus solving really challenging problems as practice. The majority of questions especially in first quant are focused on those key concepts and there’s not much room for error. It’s easy to think that if you can solve the so called hard problems you should automatically get the simpler ones right… I definitely fell into that trap…but actually that’s not always true. Even the simple concepts can be presented in a tricky way, don’t underestimate any question. For verbal, I used pairing strategy for vocabulary. I also read the sentences to myself several times to confirm that the meaning was actually alike. For reading comprehension, one advice is to focus on what is actually mentioned in the passage. It’s so tempting to select an answer because we feel like it can be assumed but always try to find the one that can specifically be found in the passage (unless it’s actually an inference question). I also think it helps a lot to fully read the reading comprehension passage the first time. Context is important for alot of the questions so if you read the question first and just try to read the part of the passage that is mentioned, you will likely miss the context, end up re reading everything anyway and waste more time in the end. Just read it properly the first time.  super relieved to be done, feel free to comment with any questions and I’m happy to answer … not sure what else to write here 😊

1,"I posted here a month ago after taking the GRE the first time— I got a 170V, 165Q, 5.5 AWA last time.  I recently retook it and just got my official scores, so I thought I’d write down what I did before I forgot!
Social sciences and business double major, applying to quantitative business programs.  Needed a perfect on the quant to be considered for schools.  
Have basic math background from business stats, calculus, and linear algebra classes.  Was definitely comfortable with math, but was much better with verbal.
Spent most of undergrad reading complicated articles and books in political science, sociology, and psychology.  Academic articles and classic novels will naturally enhance your vocab and up your reading comprehension— (I recommend Pride and Prejudice).  Excerpts from academic writing are the kind you see on the RC questions, so it doesn’t hurt to look through Google Scholar and practice reading them.
Due to background in social sciences, am very comfortable with writing— didn’t do much AWA prep at all. 
I started studying in the second week of July and studied for about 5-6 hours per day until my first GRE in the beginning of August.  So roughly 105 hours of studying.  
I began with the official math review from ETS to build my foundations up.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND doing a review of official math material BEFORE starting with a diagnostic test.  Doing so gives you a more accurate gauge of how you’ll really do after some preparation!  You really have to have a firm grasp on the formulas and mathematical rules (eg, knowing when to apply different combinatorics formula depending on the situation).  
During that month, I used the official GRE book (3rd edition), Manhattan Prep 5lb practice problems, and the Magoosh Vocabulary words (Basic I and II).  The official GRE book was good for both verbal and quant, while Manhattan was better for quant (the vocab is really specific).  HOWEVER, I did go through Manhattan vocab as well and added their words to my Flashcards.  I memorized about 1,000 words, collected from the official GRE book, Manhattan, Magoosh, and online sources.  I found that was sufficient for verbal in both times I took the test.  It helps to make sentences with each new vocab word you learn, and use mnemonics to cement them down.

PP3: V168, Q167 Experience: was supposed to test at a Prometric center, but ended up rescheduling a week before the test to take it at home in 2 days instead due to an emergency.  I was really freaked out about having such a sudden change, as I hadn’t studied much after the first GRE.  HOWEVER, I did get accommodations for a disability, which I lacked the first test.  I was kind of defeated— thinking the accommodations would be the only thing to help me improve.  I crammed and studied for about 8 hours the day before the test. heard so many horror stories about at home and was freaked out, but it honestly was a smooth experience.  My first proctor was super nice and friendly!  He helped me confirm I had extended time and other accommodations, and then launched the test with no problems.  To avoid any mishaps my housemates made themselves scarce and didn’t use the wifi.  I also read up on at home testing rules 300 times beforehand and made sure I was in compliance.  I was worried about using a whiteboard, but honestly found it to be pretty good!  Plus, in such a long test, it did help being in a familiar environment and avoiding the panic of finding parking/locating the testing center.  Not wearing a mask also helps, since breathing on yourself for 6 hours can make you really sleepy. was lucky and ended up getting the exact same prompt for the analyze an argument writing assignment that I did in my first GRE.  I didn’t know if that was allowed, so I told my proctor— he told me to continue.  I felt good about both essays by the end. heard extended time at home didn’t get an experimental section (since the test is already 6+ hours), and can confirm.  I got 2Q and 2V.  The first quant was fine, while the second gave me some problems— there were 2-3 I was unsure about, and had to guess between 2 plausible answers.  These kinds of unexpected questions happen every test, so I tried not to let it get to me.  In general, a big tip— get very comfortable with data table interpretation, since every quant section has at least 3 or so chart interpretation questions. first verbal had a couple vocab questions I struggled with, while the second verbal felt way too easy— I was worried at the end of the test that I hadn’t made it into the hard section for the adaptive difficulty.  My biggest tip for vocab is to remember to use context clues in the sentence to find what meaning they’re looking for— and when the answer wants two words, remember they must be synonyms! 
 my fellow test-takers with disabilities… my biggest recommendation is to request accommodations.  Don’t second guess yourself as to whether or not you’ll receive them (that’s what I did the first time— psyched myself out and didn’t request them, and I really suffered during my first GRE).  Send in your documentation!  You absolutely deserve to test in an environment that puts you on a level playing field with everyone else. luck to everyone here.  I know it’s rough.  Just keep doing the work where you can— but remember to give yourself a break sometimes too, and rest.

1,"Last year I started a GRE course with Manhattan Prep. I was able to get a discount since they ran a sale at the time. With the craziness of the pandemic and the political unrest in my city, I thought it best to pause my studies. I contacted Manhattan Prep, and they said it would be fine and they waived the switch fee.  I'd like to resume my studies and Manhattan Prep wants to charge me the difference from the sale discount. I can't pay extra for this, money is super tight. So I contacted my credit card to dispute the charge. I paid about $1000, and I completed half of the course. So I hoped to get half of the money back. That didn't happen. The credit card company said there's nothing they can do because it's passed their allowable time frame (118 days).  feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

1,"I am an Indian final year law student and I wrote the GRE as I wished to apply for business school. I prepared for about 3 months, but I wasn't regular as I would only practice every other day because procrastination is fun.  is what I did to prepare: Talked to friends who wrote the GRE about how I should prepare. They recommended some books and class material which I set out to get...  
\- I pirated every major GRE preparation book from libgen. There is also a torrent of Magoosh's class lectures. I hope to send some of these content creators a donation.  
\- I was really bad at maths and I had not done any maths for about 4 years. I finished the Manhattan 5 lb book and watched the Magoosh classes. I got a 1 month subscription to gre.testprep. I found this to be an excellent way get more practice problems.  
\- As the test neared, I started doing the mock tests on the back of every GRE book. I was surprised by how few there are in total. I also took Kaplan's online mock (331) and took ETS's official mocks (333 and 331).   
\- For vocabulary, I first tried [vocabulary.com]( and Magoosh's flash cards app. I realized quite late that these are inefficient methods. It is best, in my view, to make physical flash cards. I was able to expand my vocabulary rapidly with this method. Write the word on one side and its meaning on the other side. Flip through them while mentally trying to remember the meaning whenever you're free.  
\- My preparation for AWA and reading comprehension was minimal and limited to a few practice sessions. Having a habit of reading and writing definitely helps. I took Magoosh's advice for the writing sections: write lengthy essays split into indented paragraphs, use examples and fancy metaphors, and have a clear structure that includes an introduction and a conclusion. the test at home: was in my hostel room when I took the test. I asked all my friends to not disturb me during the test. The proctor checked my room using my laptop's camera. The test is very tiring as it stretches for over 4 hours. Hence, I drank a Red Bull before the test started and a second Red Bull in the 10-minute break. I drank a Red Bull right before the exam, I needed to go to the washroom at some point between two sessions. I did so after asking the proctor and he checked my wrist and ears after I came  back. experience had an urgent university deadline coming up. 15 days passed after the test and my results were not out yet. There was cause for concern. I called up the Indian ETS helpline and they told me my scores had been ""put on hold by the Office of Testing Integrity."" The lady who picked up told me she did not know anything else  and asked me to call up this office. I was confused - are they accusing me of cheating? That would be nonsense of course, but my only concern was how much time I would lose over this. called up the Office of Testing Integrity after waiting for their working hours. It was probably the first international call I ever made. I had to wait for 40 minutes to be connected to a woman with a southern American drawl (not that it matters but she was extremely rude and unpleasant). She told me she has no information either and that I should ""call back in ten business days."" Further, she said that the entire process could take six weeks. I told her that I needed my scores urgently and asked if there was anything at all I could do to know the reason for being put on ""administrative review."" She said no. Since she assured me I would get no information for the next 10 days, I asked if the delay could be acknowledged in writing. ""We do not acknowledge anything in writing,"" was the reply. Disgusted, I hung up. This person really seemed to be getting off on harassing test takers. family suggested that there was probably added scrutiny because people in my city (Hyderabad) had been cheating on the GRE, and that this had been on the news. In any case, I was running out of time. So I went on Twitter and DM'ed ETS, saying that I would have to talk about my experience publicly if my issue was not sorted right away.  day, my scores were released. They also sent me a report of my ""administrative review."" They said I had taken an ""unscheduled break"" and that I did not follow their instructions but that they're letting it slide because it did not materially affect my test. That was nonsense, of course. I had left only after confirming with the proctor and asking if I would lose any test time for it. I replied and made this known. In any case, I am happy to have gotten my scores. yes, hope you get something of value from this. Feel free to AMA. GRE is a well-made exam but if you are Indian, be prepared to deal with rude Americans with too much of an attitude if they put you on ""administrative review.""

1,"Gave the GRE today, got VQVQV, Q:170, V: 164. verbal: I'm not a native English speaker but I am pretty comfortable with the language and have read a lot ever since I can remember. That is not to say it was easy - I didn't know most of the words on GregMat's vocab list :) but yes, it was easier for me to pick out sentence structures, never struggled with that or had to prepare much on the logic of TC or SE. For prep I used Magoosh flashcards and did 20/30 of Greg's groups. I also noted down every new word I came across while solving mock tests separately (Manhattan mocks and Powerprep). This  helped!
I think RC was where where I lost all points today. I knew all the words in TC and SE for sure. 
 I solved the Manhattan 5 lb first. I sort of went in blind? Learned by solving. Not an approach I prefer. Manhattan was a good base. Solved the OG quant guide after that. I wouldn't say one is more difficult than the other. Both of them had some tricky questions, but obviously Manhattan had more in absolute numbers. I also solved all the quant questions available to GregMat+ members (I was one, GregMat ftw). And I mean ALL of them.  gave the Manhattan mocks over the course of a week and a half maybe? Gave PP1 on maybe the first day of my prep and PP2 on Saturday.
PP1 - 323, 159 V and 164 Q, but I think the quant here is supposed to be easier than both PP2 and the actual test 
Manhattan mocks - 324-326 consistently. The fifth one was 320, the last one was 330. 160+ in verbal consistently. 165 - 169 in quant. Manhattan verbal difficulty matched that of the actual test.
PP2 - 329, 160 V and 169 Q. PP quant was at exactly the same level as the actual test. prepared with a full time investment banking job.

1,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to share some of my journey studying for verbal. For context, I took the GRE 3 weeks ago and scored a 157 on my verbal. After three weeks of studying, I was able to improve to a 169. Here was my approach: Studying Vocab is important, but take some time to learn trends in questions. GRE questions often use easy vocab and parallelism in sentences. For example, a question may ask for two blanks and foil the blanks against dark and gloomy terms. Make sure to find words that correspond with the question styles. 
2. The best resources are the ETS Verbal Guide and Manhattan 5 pound prep book. Manhattan's verbal sections are challenging, but if you do them 2-3 times, you can get quite a bit of practice and gain intimacy with terms. Their sentence equivalence work will likely be most incremental to your score. 
3. Study vocab that corresponds with your training materials. I see a lot of testers use the Vince GRE vocab words or lists of Quizlet. If you use manhattan prep, find a manhattan prep set of vocab cards on Quizlet and use the learn mode. Finish at least 5-10 percent of the set a day.  is just as much about your approach as it is your vocab knowledge. Knowing how to dissect questions is critical. Even the best GRE verbal tutors don't know all the terms in the questions. However, they do know what approaches to deploy.  aside- My improvement in verbal finally got me to a 330+ score which I'm super grateful for! I am applying to some extremely competitive programs, and I always viewed my GRE score as a liability.

I have been preparing for GRE since I booked the date, Aug 25. I do have a strong profile, aided with good research experience and LoRs). And since only two of the unis I am applying for (CMU and NYU) require GRE, I did not give much time towards the prep as I had to finish writing and review some papers for a workshop at the same time. am also a polyglot - an Indian, so English was my first language at school. At the same time, I also studied the national language(Hindi) as my second and my native language (my third). Hence, I am not really focusing much on achieving good Verbal scores. I also attempted Powerprep Test-1 today (So two tests in a day). I got 144V, 170Q. I always thought I would get around 151-155 (thanks to manhattan prep scores), but 144 is very disappointing. I came across some blogs and forums saying manhattan prep is straightforward, and the actual GRE will be much harder, especially for verbal.  I am reassuring myself by saying two tests in a day (and adding an experimental section to my dismay) has to be the reason for the low scores.   I am freaking out and wondering if I will end up with a 144 Verbal score on the actual GRE, which is within a week. And the question keeps bugging me, thinking if I will end up getting a 144V score, as the universities will filter out my profiles, however good my quant and overall profile be. And Since Powerprep scores indicate my actual GRE scores, I wonder if I should have done something else instead. My expectations were 165+Q and 150+V. do I do?

1,"Just took it today QVQVQ, first time, pissed about Quant score reference:  147/170Q (no GRE practice at all took it like 1 year ago) 150/170Q.  155/169Q,  154/167Q, (taken 2 weeks before test) 161/168Q (taken day before the test) studied: intermittently past 1 year, Gregmat 2 month plan, 20 GRE big book test passages, All 3 official ETS books. I spent a very large amount of time practicing Quant and Vocab.. I mean alot resource? Big book for verbal, official material for quant, (guess i should have done manhattan 5LB, but i really really did not think i needed it). Gregmat for strategies. home test sucks, I spent like 2-3 hours rearranging my room and like 30 minutes trying to get my license not blurry. surpised with the Verbal, vocab was very easy (but sentence equiv was somewhat harder),  Passages were same difficulty as big book passages. I must have gotten a hard 2nd verbal that demolished me, which was unexpected. I must have gotten a perfect score on the first vocab and got 6 questions wrong with the harder portion. ugh. I majored in a math heavy field, got a 5 on AP calc BC, got a perfect quant score on the SAT math section. And the worst part is i probably sent 500+hours studying GRE quant. In a nutshell, Quant was very weird, and was very foreign. It was not ""hard"", but because I was not ""used to"" the questions it took me longer than usual. What was weird about them? They're like 2-3 times more verbose than typical quant questions. Different vocabulary was used which threw me off (they didnt' ""phrase"" things like they normally do questions 17-20 and 9-13). I could not differentiate between experimental quant section and the real one. Quite honestly, it feels like they ran out of Quantity A/quantity B questions and now they're making up some fucking obscure questions out of that section. I just blame the lack of material for the Quant questions, the GRE big book questions aren't really representative, even the harder big book questions. The PP/PPP probably the most representative, but that's like what ... &lt;300 good questions?  verbal journey is funny, i was always bad with verbal standardized tests, but after actually practicing and reading it got so much more easier. Really recommend gregmat for strategies, then just raw practice after. Only practiced powerscore 700 vocab, probably like 100-120 words there i still do not know .. lol that my take, I'm done with this stupid test, if i would have done it differently, I would have done manhattan 5lb??

This was feasible bc I already knew most of the vocab on greg’s list from previous studying( I used magoosh app and Manhattan flash cards). TC/SE strategies from gregmat videos helped A LOT.

1,"Before I begin I just want to say ""Whoever came up with the GRE in the first place F you mate."" will be very long, bear with me. I started prep way back in mid June and just about after 2 weeks of learning basically nothing except 200 words from Barron's 800 and completing the math review, I took PP1 and got 300 (V - 149 and Q-151). When I checked the answers I realised I had many basic errors in quants and my verbal was full of both logic and vocab mistakes.  a month doing nothing again, I found Gregmat in this sub and checked out his 8 week prep Playlist from youtube. I liked how he uses different approaches to solve the questions. Until then, I never really went outside of algebra for doing math and for Verbal using my mind to test whether an answer 'sounds' right. After finishing up the videos, I did OG book Test - 1 and got 307 (V - 154 and Q - 153). I was reluctant at first to sub to Gregmat+ because I thought I'd never be able to solve questions in the way he does and that it's too much thinking and too much analysis. But desparate for a study plan, I decided to go ahead and subscribed. And boy I'm glad I did. I say that not just because of the value I got but also if it wasn't for Greg this whole prep would have been a soul - sucking one. the mock tests. Even after seeing so many things here that only official materials are helpful, I wanted to experiment and so I  got access to about 32 mock tests (not including Big book tests) for ₹0. The worst thing was I didn't keep them for the end and I started using them as a practice. **Never use mocks for practice**. Use it only to gauge where you are at. I regularly wasted my time doing mocks for about a month, in which had I used the Big book instead it would have been so much productive. And because of this I never bought a single Powerprep+ test which ended up being a crucial blow. So I'd say that the official ones are the most real representatives for mocks. Try to buy powerprep+ 3 and if you need more go for Princeton or Manhattan.  the week before the exam came, I had a big panic attack out of fear that I wouldn't get near 160 for quants. So I decided that PP2 would be my leap of faith and if I score above 160 I'm good to go or else I'm rescheduling the test. I got 318 ( V - 157 and Q - 161). But after I completed pp2, I realized that most of the unis I'm applying to don't require Gre or has optional Gre (in which I had to score above 165) and so I dropped the prep altogether and started playing games all week and on the day before the test I took OG book test 2 and got 319(V - 158 and Q - 161). Please don't do any of this if you care about getting a high score.  finally the test day, AWA went great, I think, all thanks to Greg and I got QVQVQ. The first section felt similar in difficulty so I thought that it wasn't a experimental one and tried hard to find the answers of every question I attempted when instead I should have stuck with ""If you can't answer in 2 mins skip it,"". Didn't complete 4 or 5 questions and got an easy second quants. Followed by a somewhat difficult third one. I now have no clue which was the experimental one at all. For verbal, the words I got weren't difficult mostly, the difficult ones fortunately were the one of the very few words I learned for vocab. So I think if you learned the words from Gregmat list, or magoosh app or Vince's app you'd be prepared. Try the Pdf of Greg's list that contains all the words with the meanings, not the excel one that makes you want to hate the world itself. And for RCs I forced myself to the skim the passage as this was the only way to stop me reading the same line again and again to understand it. Unfortunately I never touched the big book (kept procrastinating) and I think that's what that caused me to be the average Joe in RCs. So practice more questions but in a effective way and you can improve your scores by a fair bit. overall I'd say, had this effort and time put for Gre prep been used for some other stuff, it would have been very useful in the long run even though whether I actually would have done that in reality is a highly valid question. Anyways I don't regret this score and so I'm not retaking the test again. If you've made it till this, Gl to you for your prep and a word for the good souls of mentors and tutors, keep up the good work and also try to have another job as well because _I'm going to perform an ancient curse to bainsh GRE from this very earth and free the people from the anguish and abomination it causes._ : a bad score initially because of bad mistakes and strategies.

Being an engineer from an elite engineering university, I didn't prepare for Quant a lot (except solving the OG and the Math Review). For Verbal, my initial score in Manhattan and Kaplan review mocks was 152. I increased it to 160 over two months by working on my vocabulary. Used the Magoosh free app for that. Reading passages were never too convoluted or scary as I'm a voracious reader. However, THE OLD GRE BOOK IS A BLESSING YOU MUST NOT IGNORE. Thanks to GregMat for that suggestion. I only subscribed to GregMat because I wanted to be diligent with my studies but he brought the notion of using that book to my life and I'm grateful.

Kudos to you, I'm expecting at least a 5 on my AWA. the actual test, the vocabulary seemed moderate compared to mock tests. In fact, mock tests only scare you with their abstruse vocab. I would finish my Verbal sections atleast 6 minutes early and check. Surprisingly, Quant on the test was taxing and full of intelligent traps. I could only save ~11 minutes to recheck compared to ~15 minutes on mocks. I also found 2 silly mistakes. Remember to always recheck your work.

1,"So after my last GRE, I felt hopeless. For the programs that I was hoping to get into, my initial Q was not enough. Genuinely spent like three to four days just randomly getting upset because I felt like such a failure for dropping 5 points from my baseline test prep score. Hopefully, if other people feel like this, this post will help. first piece of advice would be to not try to get back on the horse right away. I scheduled my second GRE literally the minute I came back from my initial test on the first day I could retake and tried to make myself study. It did not work. Take a couple days to recover from the disappointment. I got frustrated and decided not to study at all. Three or four days later, I suddenly felt ready to try again, ordered new materials, came up with a plan, etc. two resources I think helped the most for me were target test prep (the five day trial) and the Manhattan 5lb. I was still in the phase of ""oh I know all the material, it must have been bad luck/stupid mistakes"" and initially planned to just look at the practice problems and not the lessons. After taking the diagnostic test, I realized that I was much rustier on some subjects than I thought. The TTP lessons skipped the stuff that had made me refuse to review concepts before (all the prep books I found started with how addition worked, and I couldn't deal with that lol) and covered the things that were salient for the GRE. I don't know if I would have gotten much utility out of the 99$ for a month, but the five days helped a lot, especially when I reviewed things I remembered panicking on with the GRE. When I took PPP3 after TTP, to see if the math was similarly hard to the real GRE/if my scores were as bad as what I had with the GRE, I got 162V/167Q/5.0. After that, I moved onto the 5lb. I didn't complete all of it, full disclosure- again, I focused my prep on the things I got wrong on GRE score diagnostic (do an in depth review when it arrives. It helps for sure) and on things I've always been uncomfortable with. After looking at this sub, I also worked on the probability and choice section, which I think is a good move. I thought I had been prepared before, but I really don't think I was. in all, my first time around I had vastly overestimated how prepared I was based on the PP tests and how I \~felt\~ (seriously, don't base how much you study on your field- I'm in CS and was confident that meant I would automatically do well on Q. That works for some people but not for me). This time, I felt actually genuinely confident the day before (except for my worries due to taking the test at home this time). I got as much sleep as I could, cleared my room of literally anything I could, and checked in as soon as I could. I think my GRE at home went as smoothly as possible- I had read horror stories, so I refused to leave the room during the 10 minute break and kept checking in with the proctor during the break to make sure I didn't have to check my room right away. Mind you, I'm still scared that they'll cancel it for some weird reason (part of why I waited for official scores is that it would hurt to make the post then have to try again lol). I got QVQVQ, which I had been dreading. My way of coping was reasoning that if I got experimental verbal, I wouldn't have to worry about doing more quant, and that if I got experimental quant, that meant I could avoid psyching myself out if something felt hard. My first and third sections felt alarmingly easy and the second section felt really, really hard, but in a weird way- I felt like some of the questions were phrased confusingly. I feel like that must have been the experimental section. Either way, the only thing I regret was that during the last section I had \~ten minutes to spare but didn't really bother to check my answers, because I was a little burnt out and also felt like it didn't matter. Make sure to check your answers! this test really does suck, and it really is unfair. If you do poorly, that's not a sign that you've failed, or that other people have worked harder than you.

1,"Hey Everyone, am new to the GRE, having come off from GMAT and not quite cutting it. I took some ""sample"" GRE questions and saw that the GRE questions are much more up my alley, so I am switching to the GRE for business school applications. said that, what is the go-to study materials for the GRE? For example, for the GMAT, the typical tried and true materials are the Official Guide and the Manhattan Prep Strategy guides.  is something similar that I can get my hands on for the GRE? I've done a ton of studying for the GMAT and I'm sure theres some bleed-over between the two tests, so I was wondering what GRE study materials you recommend I pick up to study for 2-4 weeks.  I don't know what the question types and structure of the GRE is, can you guys point me to a website that explains this?

I didn't know Gregmat before and was solving in Magoosh. While I don't say it's bad, the videos there are pretty boring and I skipped most of them and tried to solve many problems thinking that I would develop some kind of intuition which is a BIG BIG mistake. Wasted around two months doing this. have a question for those who have finished Gregmat's two months plan. that I have a headstart and want to do prep in an organized way, I am aiming for 330+ score. I want to build my verbal basics from ground up and finish watching all verbal videos in Gregmat+.  have already learnt all words in Magoosh flash cards. I have compared them with Gregmat's vocab list and found around 300 new words in the latter. So that's like 10 new words per day which is easily achievable.  what I've done as of now:** a math major, I have solid foundation in quants. I am very clear with concepts. good grasp of vocab already. Scored 150 in all mocks in verbal already watched TC videos in Gregmat+, so I would say I am decently good at it. If I know the vocab of that question, there's an 80% chance of me solving it correctly. All thanks to Math strategy to improve on:** encountered many new words in mocks despite learning all words from Magoosh flash cards. I have to learn around 300 non overlapping words in Gregmat's vocab list. Hopefully this would cover my prep for SE also in verbal I am very good at math, I forgot most of the shortcuts, tips and tricks and I am making lot of silly mistakes. Thought of watching all quant tips/tricks, toolkit videos in Gregmat+. Hopefully this won't take much time. I also want to finish Manhattan 5-lb book which I've never touched before. have no clue on RC. My accuracy in mocks for RC oscillated between 30% to 60%. I want to watch all Grammer, Rephrasing, Reading videos to build a solid foundation for RC these in mind, how feasible is it to finish Greg's 2 months plan in 1 month ?

1,"It’s GRE season so I’m sharing my journey for anyone out there with a similar starting point. 🤓 Gregmat+ was helpful, follow the process, study hard, and you'll do fine! Remember it's just a test! 0 - Diagnostic score 308 (156V/152Q)** Took the test cold on the ets website, the free untimed test.
* QUANT:  Did about as well as I thought I would given that I never took geometry and didn’t know any formulas, or approaches for combinations, probability, or more advanced topics.
* VERBAL: On verbal I struggled a lot on the vocab and otherwise didn’t really know what to focus on.
* Next Steps: Studied on my own to learn geometry and new vocab. 1 Month of Study - Paper test 318 (160V, 158Q)** 💪 a nice bump in the first month of study, this was with the paper based practice test in the ets guide. VERBAL: I spent three weeks studying vocab from greg's list. My approach was myopic in nature in that I attempted rote memorization through quizlet, and this made retaining esoteric words much more challenging.
* QUANT: For quant I went through all of the math review sections in the ets guide. I also went through the dedicated geometry sections in the ets quant guide and Manhattan prep quant prep. I memorized all of the relevant area formulas, how to calculate standard deviation, and how to calculate combinations. Not a lot of this came up though and I really only used basic triangle and polygon rules.
* Other: I had watched a few gregmat videos also and learned about the paring strategy for the verbal portion. For quant he makes it seem super obvious and easy, and I think that helped with my confidence.
* Next Steps: 320 was actually my original target score, but since I still had 2 months to study I moved my goal post to 330. This sub is full of sycophants for gregmat so I signed up for Gregmat+ at this point. To be honest I didn’t like his teaching style from the free YouTube videos, I found it to be very pedantic and dismissive of student questions; some interactions with students gave me major [Anton]( vibes. Still the free content was good so I gave it a chance and followed the 2 month plan on Gregmat+. 2 Months of Study; 1 month with Gregmat+: Timed ETS PT 323 (161V, 162Q)** 🤑 my second month I simply followed the first 4 weeks of the gregmat+ study plan, which is easier said than done since the study plan is more of a gre bootcamp. Nearly every day there’s 4 - 6 hours worth of content + homework, and it could take even longer if the concepts don’t clique right away. I actually liked having a lot of content to study though, and it pushed my score into the mid 320 range. Verbal: I did okay in everything EXCEPT for the reading passages, which made sense since up to this point the gregmat+ plan mainly focused on sentence completion and the passage studying didn't start until the second month. 
* QUANT: For quant I did a little bit better because in the gregmat+ studyplan you basically relearn arithmetic, Algebra, and Geometry in the first 4 weeks. Where I did poorly was in time management, which again made sense since we hadn't really covered test taking strategies in the study plan up to this point. this time Greg did grow on me and I learned that it was the students who were annoying me all along. I remember once someone raised their hand to ask ""my test is in two weeks what can you do for me"" in the middle of a concept review. Greg handled these questions with a lot of patience, humor, and tact, much better than I would have for sure 😅. I was happy with the results so I continued with the 2 month plan. 3 Months of Study; 2 months with Gregmat+: Timed ETS PT 319 (160V, 159Q)** ☠️ Africa what happened?]( I took the second free PT on the ETS website and dropped 4 points from the last mock. This was 4 days before my exam and I was shooketh! In hindsight this was a good wake up call, as I took 2 weeks off before taking this mock. The math was easy, but I was cocky and didn’t read carefully. On verbal I had ignored the processes Greg taught us and went with my gut on one too many answers. I still had a few days so I did some targeted study prep for the passages since I still struggled with that, made sure I knew all of the words on Greg’s vocab list, and reviewed the different ways the gre would try to trick me on the quant section. important I promised myself I would just follow the processes I’d learned and ignore my gut, like a machine [on the hunt for Sarah Connor.]( This is what Greg hammers home in a lot of videos, follow the process and be flexible. SCORE 327 (165V, 162Q) 👀** took the test at home and had no major issues with the proctor, setup, or anything else. It was a little annoying giving proctor u full access to my laptop, and the proctor was able to see a bunch of my files when they were changing my settings around. 🥸 into the essays I memorized the formats recommended by Greg and these proved extremely helpful for organizing my thoughts, especially for the argument essay where you need to point out the assumptions. going into the verbal and quant sections. quant the first section was similar to everything we reviewed on gregmat+ and the challenging part was just reading the questions carefully. There were multiple times where one specific word completely changed the answer and anyone rushing through the test would have missed these cues. Little things like the word “integers” or “even numbers” were super important and Greg made sure to instill the importance of such terms during the 2 month plan. better or worse my second quant section was way harder and let me tell you it was an absolute monster 👹. Don’t get me wrong some of the questions were actually fun little puzzles, but at least half of them were soul crushing in complexity. It felt like I was back in middle school taking a math test I hadn’t studied for. The questions were nothing like anything I’d seen before and it would have taken me 5 minutes or more to solve each one, so I skipped them. They weren’t like gmat questions either, where you have to know a very specific rule or trick to solve them, they were just hard gre problems back to back to back to back. I definitely bombed this section and I’m okay with that, there is no way I’d get to the level of solving these problems quickly without dedicating another 3 months and I just don’t have the time. verbal I had the experimental but there was nothing too crazy. I channeled my inner Greg on almost every question - I remember one question where I did the paring strategy but the pairs weren’t as good as one of the single words and I know that old me would have picked the single word even though it didn’t have a pair, but the new me, the Greg me, picked the pair because that’s the process. I still struggled with passages, but Greg me focused on crossing out wrong answers and then justifying the best possible answer. I think the only thing I really ignored were the 3 blankers, I just skipped them and focused on getting the right answers on everything else. One 3 blanker was especially nasty and I would have easily spent 5 minutes on it if I didn't skip it - a skill I learned through Greg. thoughts..** the end I’m happy with the score I got, and I think anyone could achieve a similar score if not better given enough time. In my opinion the score only tells you how much time and how effective someone was with that time with respect to studying. Gregmat+ is helpful if you have the time to do the 2 month plan and actually follow through with the homework and lessons every day, but nothing will change your score if you don't put in the time. I think in total with the plan and my first month I put in 160 hours for this dumb test; I could have learned to code, started a business, or spent that time with my family, but instead I have a 3 digit number that will be on my grad school application. 🙃 But hey at least it's good for 5 years.",308 to 327 a prosaic GRE study journey recap,1630737228,9,1688,1
1,"Thanks to Gregmat and Vince for top quality materials and GOD level contribution to the GRE community!  Say : I scored above my expectation. Guess I won my frustrating 50-50's in verbal. Post ever I guess but complete honest story of how I grew over these 2.5 months in GRE. : CS undergrad from India working in IT from last 3 years.  me first address the stupid assumption  : No - it doesn't matter what you are. Everything was fucking difficult for me. No one is going to believe but I struggled a lot in BOTH Quant and verbal. Tons of silly mistakes like 9\*7 =56, getting confused whether 112-29 is 83 or 93. yeah - I was that bad. But then this is in my nature : I hit rock bottom ,get sad and frustrated and then I work hard.  Materials : Gregmat paid subscription + ETS material + Manhattan 5LB quant only as greg suggested + Awesome solution book of Vince for Free ETS tests + One ""dark"" website with free PPP+ tests (life saver) + 1 awesome Quant cheat Sheet by TTP (15 page) + [vocabulary.com](  I developed : I don't care about the MCQ answers during the prep. I need to calm my mind about any question - there shouldn't be nagging ideas that this method could be correct, this could be wrong.What if I did this.what if I did that.. Solve each of it and find it for yourself. This was painful but really good -especially for my quants. I also did a LOT of untimed prep.never touched the timer in 1.5 months of prep. Details : Total 2.5 months. 2 months of prep like 2-4hr everyday. Some weekends even 8hrs. Last 2 weeks - full on attack. Sacrificed all plans whether its a 1hr lunch party or small bday party. No time to get distracted. Only exception was helping  a friend through depression( Far more important than all this). scores :  I was Shit scared to give PP1 in 1st week of prep. This was a mistake as I could never gauge how I am improving with my studies. To each his own - I felt seeing a low score then was not good for me then so let it be. : 322 ( 1 month of prep) : 320 (2 month of prep) - Yeah it went down, I know. attitude landed me in trouble here ( I was prepared for it as well). Pretty shit score tbh. In PP1 I could never finish any section on time. 3-4 questions were left in all. I was wasting too much time everywhere. I realised that I was taking too much time to apply the verbal strategies and for quant I was not committing to a method. Expected since I never prepared under time stress. Advantage ? Concepts were clear - my methods were clear - my brain was trained nicely since I did not apply time pressure right from start. I just needed to pick the pace. Accuracy was high (except a few pitfalls). Strategy :  5LB helped me here. Went through solutions, cross-checked my mistakes and drilled down hard on where I was going wrong. Painful but results were good. Now an unpopular opinion : because I was trying out multiple strategies I was losing time in Quant. Hear me out - If I keep thinking whether to plug in answers OR choose a number and estimate OR actually solve this thing --- I lose time and there is no sure way to know. So I decided a set strategy I would try for different topics and type of questions and practice that. Results were wonderful. I scored 165/165+ in OG paper based tests Quant. I gained confidence after 63 days of starting my GRE prep ! For DI - I was making mistakes with estimation -everywhere it was written and all tutorials encouraged to make safe estimation but don't know why I messed up fractions and % with estimation.I then stuck to what I knew best : solve the shit out. Use calculator for DI. Took 1 more minute but my confidence grew and the pace as well. I was losing confidence with estimation ( I am not talking about estimation of graph values - I am talking of estimation of %/\* required in last questions of DI ). MEGA -- I was pretty much slaying after I got all this sorted out. Very happy with my Quant work. Strategy : was so painful. Did gregmat list and 5-7 OLD book Tests as per greg study plan. Did go through all strategies and practiced applying them as well but it just did not work perfectly like quant. However I tried my best. Read and compared my thinking with Vince book of Free PP tests to find where am I going wrong with my thought process. I posted a lot of queries here in reddit space and Vince helped me here as well.  The thing is I don't know what I did right or wrong. yes - I prepared the 800 greg list very well but vocal was definitely not the reason I scored 162. Only explanation I have is I put a lot of work messing up my mind over where and why I am going wrong and being hard on myself and finally understand that ETS is out there to twist and toy with you in verbal. TRAPS! Just give your best and move on. DO NOT RE-READ RC again and again !! :-P  Elimination strategy was king for me here. Hands down. Also learn  how wrong options are designed - either they fall under NO EVIDENCE or CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE category. I actually spent 3 whole day applying this elimination strategy with Vince book for PP1 verbal all 4 sections ( 1st , E, M,H) to understand that and I think this trained my subconscious brain a lot ! Then It started to hit me while reading and solving questions (untimed) and finally with more practice - I was able to apply it at a limited scale on actual timed tests as well. will have to make another post to share actual testing experience like what topics came the most/test centre experience/etc  However since most of the test takers answer all those regularly- I thought the above might be more useful to give you people the confidence that you actually don't have to follow others. It is about finding what works for you and sticking to it. You will know it and you will see the results. It is alright if you go against some popular opinions but FIND what works for you and make a plan. I mean I pretty much trained my brain like a maniac .. even imagined how will I react if I had a  bad AWA ( which I eventually did) ; how will I reset my mind after each section (use instruction page to take more than 1 min break)  ; how will I use my 10min break ; everything.  yes I never scored beyond 325 in my mocks ( in fact I did not give any FULL mocks except PP1 and PP2). I am very bad at multitasking so I did focused prep. Gave 4 section of Quant one after other with timer and no disturbance. Rough sheet and all to emulate the exam. For Verbal 3 sections are enough to take a whole day since there was SO MUCH conflict - 50-50 dilemma.   DO THIS . Give full tests only to prepare better.  Since I had not prepared under time stress initially ; I had to do another round of focused prep using questions from PPP+ and OG paper tests which you are better off using as FULL MOCKS.    
 ONLY ETS MATERIALS !! One more reason I did good was I rarely tried any other material except ETS. Man, ETS material is so vast ( if you include PPP+) that I was not even able to complete that. People who are ""rushing through"" ETS material is doing wrong. You got to SIT with it and analyse every shred of it to beast it. Don't care about getting answers right - care about that you selected the right answer with 99%+ confidence and had no second thoughts ( extremely difficult to do in verbal).",Story of my GRE PREP : Official Score 332 ( 170 Q / 162V) AWA 4.0,1630697352,17,1526,1

1,"Hello, fellow Redditors. Just received my official GRE score. I took the test last week (25th August, to be precise). A brief background about me: I am an undergrad Computer Science student from a non-native English country (India). Hence, I was way more confident with the quant than with the verbal.  So I had already read Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis when I started with my preparation. So I was at an advantage there. Apart from that, I made sure to go through most of the word lists by Gregmat (more on him later). I would suggest, at least go through the first 20 lists. Most of the words that I encountered on my actual test belonged to those lists. I would also agree with the other tutors saying that GRE verbal is not just about vocab, but it's more of a logic-based test. You have got to know about the grammar, sentence structure to answer SE/TC questions more easily. Gregmat's pairing strategy works wonders when you are not sure in SE questions.  quant, I just solved Manhattan 5lb book completely. It gave me an essential understanding about the type of questions asked in the actual test. Also, I solved the GRE OG for both quant and verbal. I used to solve the questions that the other redditors would post here. That was a good practice for me. It was fun helping others here :)  AWA, I just watched the two YouTube videos of Gregmat where he explains the structure of his prompt, which helped a lot. Followed his instructions during my test. did all this in around 1 and half month's time, with an average of 2-3 hours of practice everyday. test scores:** I just took the 2 official free mock tests that come with registering for GRE test. My scores are as follows: 330 (Q170, V160) 326(Q167, V 159) Test:** I took the test at a test center. The folks there were kind and helpful and helped the test takers with any issue faced. It was a smooth process. I got a VQVQV test. There is an optional break of about 10 minutes after the section 3. I took the break, but took it just to calm my nerves. The last verbal section was perhaps the experimental section for me as the SE/TC questions were ridiculously perplexing. After the test got over, I got the option to report the score or cancel the score. After selecting to report the score, I got a search interface where I could select up to 4 universities to send my scores. You need not remember the code for your desired university. I was able to find my universities without much effort. 2 cents:** I would say, the verbal section of the actual test is on par with the PP tests. I did find the actual test's quant to be quite convoluted, but if you have got the concepts and the fundamentals right, then you will do just fine. Try to enjoy this process. I have definitely become a better reader due to this test. Also, while taking the mock tests, try to attempt the AWA section as well. I did not do that, and the actual test felt too exhausting for me. Also, do not presume which section will be the experimental one. Attempt all the sections with equal seriousness and attention. would like to thank all the redditors who remain active here and solve others' queries and doubts. Especially to Gregmat whose videos made it possible for me to enjoy the vocab part. Gregmat is that cool teacher that teaches but does not feel like he is teaching something as boring as vocabulary. all the fellow Redditors who are still preparing for the test, you got this.  free to ask me anything about the GRE test.","Official Score: 329 (Q: 170, V: 159, AWA: 4.5).

I did look up some old tests for extra RC practice. I also used the Magoosh flashcards for vocab, but truthfully didn’t finish more than three or four of the decks. I watched Gregmats videos for VR, QR, and AW strategies. 
I work full time so I only had time to study for maybe 1-3 hours each day. I set up a weekly study plan that covered 9 weeks. I reviewed approximately 5 QR chapters each week from the MP book (doing 20-30 problems per chapter). I reviewed 3 VR chapters each week. I watched approximately two of Greg Mats videos each week. I can provide pictures if anyone’s interested in seeing a more detailed study plan.  Day:
I chose the test at home option. I was using a new laptop for the test vs the practice tests so that made me a little bit nervous. Overall, I would say I had a good experience. My proctor was pretty chill and responsive when I asked if I could leave the room during the ten minute break. The timing felt crazy on the real test compared to the practice tests. I actually ran out of time on one of the QR sections, and didn’t have time to review my answers for both of the VR sections and the other QR section. I had an experimental VR section. Running out of time was really stressful and frustrating as that had never happened during any of the practice tests. But I would say that I didn’t have any problems with the “at home” part of testing.  hope this is helpful who is starting studying soon and doesn’t have a lot of time to study and wants to know about testing at home!","GRE Studying to Testing Experience (161V, 163Q, 5.5AW)",1630627710,12,520,1
1,"Q:155 V:154 AWA:4.5  
I gave myself around 3 months to prepare for my GRE but, due to an extremely hectic work life, I could only take out some weekends and the last two weeks before my exam to do all of my preparation. I was somewhat satisfied with my Verbal and AWA score but, was extremely disappointed with Quant. I was expecting much more. I don't understand what went wrong. I got a 160+ in both the PowerPrep's, practiced all questions from Manhattan 5lb book and the ETS official books, did questions from Big book as well. (was able to get a good portion of them correct)  
I'm extremely perplexed as to what my next steps should be since I can only afford giving this exam one more time, with respect to both cost and time (max till first week of Nov). And I have an added fear that I won't do as good in Verbal and AWA as I did last time. If anyone has tips, on how to boost up atleast my quant score(which I couldn't do despite enough practice), that'll be awesome, thanks!",Advice for a 309 scorer,1630612771,5,216,1

|**Official GRE**|**299(V 148, Q 151)**| need your advise on my second attempt for GRE. I gave my GRE yesterday and scored drastically less than my practice tests. After my exam I didnt think of it and today I am still exhausted but have to think abt it any way. I prepared whole heartedly for 2/3 months. (1 month to warm up my mind who hadn't study for 2 yrs after college). I made my own hand written flashcards with all words from Magoosh and others that I got from 5lb and practice test which were exclusive of Magoosh, a month practiced consistently with quant completed whole 5lb learned concepts, shortcuts i didnt knew from a set of 30 questions almost always I got 20 right. Along with it i was making flashcards and learning new words as well. Then in august i started to focus more on verbal, practicing from same 5lb and was worse at getting at getting correct answers except SE. I thought practice will make it. But still end of the preparation I was not faring in score although I had built good vocab. started to give my practice tests 13 days b4 exam as I took leave from office for 2 weeks and I scored ***308x2,312x2,314x2 from Manhattan, 302 in PP1, 304 in Princeton and a day b4 exam 314 in PP2.***  Manhattan scores I was certain to get 31x on D Day and from PP2 as well.  day b4 exam I slept only for 2hrs but was composed all the time. Didnt feel drowsy or anything. Essays were good might score 4.5.  But I struggled a lot for Quant I was not able to get even geometry related answers to the match. After getting score card I will be able to guage it.  should I do? Ofc, give 2nd attempt but I am all lost. Even average of all my scores is 310. I knew my verbal will be somewhere 152 154 but quant gave me big surprise. I have a uni in my mind and course as well which interests me. am lost on verbal statetgy. I was getting a feeling I should read books more articles more but that is it. want to score in 330s in my next attempt it is all or none scenario for me. And also I have to manage my office at the same time. I am so exhausted rn. I had thought I will start my certifications and start LOR and SOPs.

1,"My test is in 11 days and I'm feeling a bit demoralized. After PP1, I got 164 for Quant and 149 for Verbal. Given that I'm going into engineering, it isn't TOO bad. However, I still think 149 for Verbal is not an ideal score. I've watched all of Gregmat videos and I understand the strategies. The only problem is that I don't know enough of the vocabulary. Often I'm blindly guessing because I don't understand the words at all. I find RC to be the easiest of the 3 types of questions, but it's still a bit difficult for me. However, I manage to finish the entire set within the time limit. I'm worried I won't have enough time to learn more vocab.  been using the following to study: Manhattan 5LB for Quantitative (I've done about half of all the chapters, so I'm sure my score will go up when I refresh certain topics that I'm rusty on)

1,"Disclaimer: This is a Rant. So if you are looking for something as an advice or tip, this post is not for you. Although one thing that you can take away from this post is don't be as incompetent as I am. I have had two attempts to the GRE. In my first attempt I got 273. And in my second attempt 291(sept 1 2021). I had studied extremely hard. Did possibly everything I could for the preparation. Gave so many mock tests and even reached around 310 and 316 in the ets powerprep mocks. If I had to use a word from Greg's list I'd say I feel extremely crestfallen. Lugubrious if you are looking for another synonym. I did everything I possibly could. Now I am out of funds to give the exam again. I wanted to apply for fall 2021 but my score said otherwise. I gathered up courage and gave it my all. Had sleepless nights, scoured the greprepclub and solve possibly anything i could find. Hell i even tried GMAT questions. I am pretty sure I am possibly the only one who despite doing all of this has not managed to cross even 300. I have no idea what went wrong with me. And I so wish I could blame my toxic surrounding or even my mental health but honestly that would be a craven (another word from Greg's list) excuse to avoid or possible be evasive towards acknowledging my mistakes. I feel so agitated inside out. Please don't give me that ""It is just an exam"" when you clearly do not come from a position where spend the last of your funds and give your all and even sacrifice pretty much every possible thing yet you get defeat in return. I do not want to acquiesce to the result i have got but I can only do so much. I find it implausible as to how a person who solves all ets questions and greprepclub questions accompanied by manhattan 5lb gets an incompetent score. I really have no idea what on earth must have went wrong. Anyway, I have decided that some things are destined to be let go. I'll end this rant here since it has become conspicuously mawkish.

1,"Hello! took the test today. I got a few messages asking me about my score and I was kind of annoyed because how are my scores going to help anybody? Maybe I even came across as rude when I said this to people who messaged me. Sorriee :) . Everyone on this sub seems to have a 330+ score and I was so reluctant to tell anybody about mine. Maybe many people like me do not say their scores either, and probably delete their previous posts regarding GRE and all and just idk- take the test again or suffer or both.

* GregMAT- AWA Template got the QVQVQ thing. First Q was good, to my knowledge I was unsure of 3 questions in this section. First V was okayish, I hastened through the Reading Passage and I obviously did mess up there. Second Q was a bit tough. I would assume it to be my experimental. The second verbal was smoother with easier RC and difficult SC (I would acknowledge the difficulty levels can be subjective). The last Q made me very happy because I thought it was not experimental and I could score more in this section, bruh Idk 159 sucks kind of, for me.  am planning for Canadian Universities and since I do not have any substantial research background, and I am a senior right now in university, I was depending on the GRE to give my profile a boost.

This subreddit helped me a lot as I pretty much read about all the experiences posted hence I am posting mine .Here it goes: I gave my exam at a Prometric center ( Kolkata, India), as I didn't want to encounter any problems that could occur in at home version. The testing experience was pretty smooth and staff at the center was extremely responsive. onto the exams:
My order was VQVQV, this is what I wanted because despite being from an engineering background I struggled with quants during my practice. All the three verbal section were pretty much of the same difficulty so it was difficult to guess the experimental one but they were all of the same difficulty as ETS mocks. Shoutout to u/gregmat, his 1 month plan was great . In quant, I did manage to encounter 2-3 probability questions which were a bit tough but rest all resembled PPP+ level. Again, I would like to thank Gregmat for this; his quant strategies are severely underated. For AWA I just followed the format of issue and argument essays discussed by Gregmat in his videos.
The most important thing I feel is to maintain your level of concentration. It is quite difficult to do so for 4+ hrs and by the time the last section arrived, I did lose some of my focus hence I got a below expectations score in verbal. prep materials:
Quant: Manhattan 5lb, ETS official guides
Verbal: ETS official guides, Gregmat's word list
Practice tests: ETS powerprep mocks and  Manhattan mocks study schedule was pretty erratic since I am a full time working professional but still I finally managed to give GRE and get a decent score.

* GREGMAT the saviour's Wordlist and free videos 
* Magoosh words
* Magoosh subscription (6 month)
* Target prep 1 month subscription
* Manhattan tests
* 2nd hand books from my friends - Manhattan 5Lb(barely solved it), Official GRE Quant and Vebral guide.
* GRE big Book (Gold for RCs) Review:  Tested tutor, Good material, free but a big chunk of the content overlaps with GREGMAT 
* GREG MAT, Didn't refer Quant content, But it's the gold standard for verbal. If you are tight on cash then just stick to this, it is 5$ a month which is 400rs, It cannot get any better and cheaper than this. It also has 2 pre made study plans that you can follow
* TTP, Amazing quality, very detailed, people are always there to guide you, When I was struggling with Data Interpretation, I reached out to them and Jeff was more than willing to answer my queries. If you have shaky math foundations and have a minimum of 2 months at hand then buy TTP. It's a comprehensive solution that will cover everything from start to end. Cons: Doesn't have verbal. only con although a big one
* Magoosh - Contrary to what Greg says, magoosh has decent verbal questions, upto hard difficulty levels. Beyond that they just use big words from some remote corner of the oxford english dictionary to inflate the level of difficulty. Math is a bit harder than what you'll see on the test. They also have videos which is a bonus. And at 99$ for 6 months +3 months of verbal access, It is among the cheapest options, second only to greg mat.
* Manhattan 5lb and the test series: The 5lb book has great quant questions. Same for the 30$ test series. But the verbal section is crap. They use words which I have never seen on any of the other wordlists. Just stick to the 5lb Quant section, and don't buy the test series unless you only want to test your quant skillz
* GRE guides - Official guides for both Quant and Verbal are really good, albeit short(150 question each). The Big Book is a must have for improving you're verbal score. Its the best resource to practice authentic ETS verbal questions  background and Strategy used: a CS grad from India, with relatively sound quant and verbal foundations as I had studied for the GMAT a couple of years ago. I prepared for a total of 6 weeks. My baseline score without any prep was 321. Over the last 6 weeks, I did not follow any definite structure.  would just haphazardly solve TTP questions, sometimes over 100 a day. I identified my problem areas, which were quantitative comparison, statistics, data interpretation reading comp. After reaching the 1600 question mark on TTP, I had a mini burn out. I started hating math and didn't want to look at it. Took a week off from quants and did verbal. I did 10 vocab sets a day from the magoosh app everyday. During the last week I made a list of words that the greg mat list had but magoosh didn't. I must've memorised over a 1200 words. Simultaneously, I read this book called Fountain head by Ayn Rand and every time I came accross a new word I noted it down and googled its meaning. RCs, I tired the simplification strategy (gregmat), and while it is extremely effective, I couldn't do it in the given amount of time. However I used another a trick which worked wonders for me. Instead of simplifying the sentences i just translated them to hindi/tamil and this allowed me to retain most of the passage. This was so effective that I finished the first verbal section on the test in 18 mins. This was surprising because a couple of weeks ago I was barely able to get more than half of the RC questions right. Tests: took a mock test every weekend, sometimes even 2. After the first mock itself I realised that manhattan verbal is dog crap and no one should use if for anything other than quant practice 321 (Q161,V160) 324(Q161,V163) - I googled a few meanings hence this increase  test - 321 (Q162,V159) 1 - 324 (Dont remember) - 322(Q164,V158) this I implemented the translation strategy. (skipped 2, 2 weeks before Gre) -322 (Q162,V160) this I stopped practicing verbal except for RCs. Didn't practice TC and SE except for the last 3 days of prep. I started solving magoosh math questions and reviewing the mistakes I made on TTP. I had an accuracy of about 87% on TTP. I reviewed all the mistakes and found all the traps I fell for. However, I wasn't 100% confident that I would be able to attain my target quant score of 170.  Mock, One day before GRE - 328 (Q164,V164) didn't cross check my answers in any of the mocks, even in the last mock that I took, because I knew it was a mock and I wanted to get done with it asap. Test Experience: 1: The first section was quant, and I was the hardest quant section that Ive ever seen. Some of the questions were borderline unsolvable unless you knew the concepts.  I F'ed up massively here because I panicked. I knew I had screwed up and I was already preparing myself mentally to see a sub 160 score. 2: The First verbal section was pretty straight forward. I finished it in 20 mins. I had marked 3 questions for review and 2 of them indeed were wrong. I was pretty confident that I was getting a near perfect score in this section 3: This section was piss easy. Must've gotten most of them right. The questions were a lot easier than magoosh, TTP and manhattan questions. The level of difficulty was similar to the old GRE papers. This was when I told my self ""you've definitely fucked up the 1st section and you have been handed and easy section"". Finished it in 25 mins and religiously reviewed each and every question. Found 2 mistakes, both of them trap options. 4: Lord alone knows wtf they asked. Like seriously, wtf was that? Even after memorising 1200 words I saw 4 new words, and to my misfortune I saw 3 of them in a single SE question. Couldn't apply  elimination. However, the RCs were manageable. They managed to keep my sinking ship afloat.   5: Easier, much easier than the 1st section and a tad harder than the second quant section. This was when it dawned on me that maybe the first section could've been experimental??There were just 2 questions the  F'ed my brain up, one was on permutations and the other was a multiple correct one in stats. proctor was kind, the test experience was smooth. There were no hiccups. To those planning to give the GRE, my biggest advice would be to build up the mental stamina to give a test for 4 hours. By the end of 4 hours I was almost dead (moribund), hungry and cranky. I submitted my last section with a couple of minutes to spare. DO NOT DO THIS.

I had taken the GRE previously at home and had gotten a score of 326 (V - 163, Q - 163). I faced technical issues during the test which affected my test taking experience.

For quant the main thing that I think immensely helped me for the second attempt was timing my practice sessions - I set a timer of 30 mins everytime I sat down to solve questions. This was really helpful for me since it helped to emulate the pressure of solving questions with the time constraint. Time management was definitely a big problem during my first attempt. main resources that I used to practice quant apart from the official ETS material were the gregmat questions (on their website), Manhattan 5lb and  Big Book(technically also ETS but often not recommended along with the other official ETS material) .I also brought the 1 week trial offered by TargetTest prep verbal I had done vocab from Barron's 1100 , but for my second attempt I followed gregmats list, I would definitely recommend gregmats list..I think I probably only encountered a single word that I did not know the meaning of. Gregmats strategies for TC, SE and RC were really helpful ! Big Book and official ETS I felt were more than enough to practice strats for verbal. addition to this I took a lot of mocks, I had unfortunately exhausted all the official mocks when I was preparing for my first attempt (including the paid ones) - I would recommend that you save the powerprep plus ones if you think you would want to retake the GRE.

1,"My goal for GRE studying wasn't to have a fantastic score, just to be able to juggle both 50 hours a week of work, as well as family commitments, while getting a score I could be proud of! I had never taken any higher math classes before studying for the GRE– only algebra 1. What worked for me: Hours: I limited my studying to 2 hours, one in the morning and one after work. I also watched Gregmat videos in airports, during lunch, etc. while traveling for work.
2. Study materials: I used Magoosh apps for my vocabulary. For fill in the blanks/word pairings, Manhattan 5lb. book was the most accurate in my experience. The official GRE prep was definitely the closest for quantitative questions. Gregmat helped me be able to guess more confidently on quant questions I did not know.
3. I consistently did practice tests once a week. I also made it a point to stay active, hydrated and well fed!
4. Day of: I used positive affirmations, ""I know what I'm doing, I have done this before, I am smart, etc."" Left very early for the testing center.

I'm scheduled to retake the GRE this Saturday, but have not studied at all since I took the test 3 weeks ago. I was hoping that taking a mental break would help me relax. This entire process has been the most frustrating, costly, time-consuming experience I've ever dealt with, especially on top of working full time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I'm convinced that it does not assess one's ability to succeed in business school or in life. It tests one's ability to take a test, and I am not good a good test taker.

I took the 8 week Manhattan Prep course, and saw no improvement to my score. The stress of the pandemic and losing my job caused me to give up any motivation I had, and I never took the GMAT.

1,"The answer lies in the question itself. English is my first language and it had never disappointed me until i saw my GRE Verbal Score! My Verbal mock scores avg is 162 most grave error: Overestimation of my skills to crack the verbal sections. I not practice enough? Hell no! I finished Manhattan 5lbs and ETS mocks. I not learn enough vocab words? Nope, 900-1000 words is a decent repertoire. what did I miss? 1: my accuracy level in RCS was never over 60%  I did not dive deep into the errors and always thought I just did not read the passage well enough. Or once I saw the correct answer, i thought to myself,  ""oops! of course it has to be this, I just need to more mindful while reading of what the passage talks about"" 2: My error log consisted of 0 errors from the RC questions. RC does not just test your ability to find, rather spot the answer in the passage but evaluates your ability to read, understand the passage and also be able to infer information that may not be explicitly mentioned. This needs a thorough comprehension of parts like 1. the authors intent of writing 2. Ability to read between the lines to infer the not so obvious details 3.Connect parts of the passage that may not be written in a particular order to make sense of the overall passage. addition to mere reading and getting a gist of the passage, all of the above need strategies to tackle the information thrown at you. Specific type of practice and not just blind solving of as many questions as you can lay your hands on and the ability to accomplish all of this within the time allotted is not something that can be overlooked post is mainly for people who have a command over the language and could possible overlook these details while prepping for the verbal section.

* Verbal: IMO higher difficulty than what is needed. However, good for practice and increasing speed.
* Writing: Good for practice. Also provides some sample responses but does not grade your response. Did not apply any TC and RC strategy as I was habitual to my approach.

* Official GRE quant (complete) big book: verbal portion from 1-10 tests lb: sections where I was weak (probability, normal distribution etc) tests: Magoosh test 1: 312
* Magoosh test 2: 318
* Magoosh test 3: 321
* Magoosh test 4: 319  this point, a small set of questions (a set of data interpretation/ RC passage) starts to repeat. Princeton: 318
* PP1: 328
* PP2: 326 1 test experience: messed up my essay but rocked the argument part. Received VQVQV format so slightly disappointed. Started with my first V section, here is where shit hit the fans. The section was okayish, worked through the questions and skipped some of them to come back to again. As I reached the 20th question, I accidentally double clicked and went into the next section without ever attempting all the questions from the first section (hard facepalm and huge panic). Understandably was upset but tried my all in the next sections. Prayed in the break that please the first section be experimental. Gave the rest of the test.  V150 Q163 AWA 4.0 so disheartened that I cried when I called and told my mother. I know the score is not bad but the practice had given me confidence of 320+ up my mind for 2nd attempt. I will honestly advise that only give another attempt if you can bear the mental pressure/the score is too low from your goal AND you are able to get close enough marks in practice tests) 2 Prep : 1 month mentally exhausted, so took a week long break (highly recommended to recharge yourself) learnt the gregmat words list by heart (all 900 of them). This is one indispensable resource and I can't stress its importance enough. Re-did all the official books again (I feared I might get steered away from official standards otherwise)

* Manhattan lb: mixed practice set tests: Kaplan: 325
* Manhattan: 329 2 test experience: up the writing portion pretty bad since I did not practice this at all. The format was QVQVQ (looked like the stars had aligned for me). The first portion for both Q and V were okayish. V2 was slightly tough and I was unsure of some of my responses. Both Q2 and Q3 were slightly tough compared to Q1 and I even had to make some intelligent guesses (time shortage). V164 Q170 AWA 3.5 score had surprised me since almost never got past 160 in verbal. 170 in quant was also a pleasant surprise since I actually had made some guesses.

No complaints whatsoever. coming to the actual test - I ended up with a VQVQV. The first verbal section was really hard. And I mean extremely hard - words I had never heard of before, two long passages in the same section and two critical reasoning questions as well. This was most likely the experimental section. The rest of the test was pretty okay. Both the verbal sections that followed were doable. The middle verbal section was a tad bit easier than the last one. The level of difficulty of these sections were comparable to that of the PP2 test (I personally did not purchase the PPP tests, just in case I needed to retake the GRE again). coming to the math sections. None of the questions encountered were any harder than the quant questions provided in the official ETS material. The first quant section was really easy - I had almost 14 minutes left to go over my work once I was done with my first round of solving. The second quant section, as expected, was a bit harder. But these were still solvable - nothing too extreme. I think the ability that helped me the most was knowing how and when to let go of a quant problem instead of being obsessed with it for too long. The lack of this was something I suffered from when I was preparing, and thankfully, I was able to overcome it :) circling back to one of the most commonly asked questions on this forum: is GRE quant getting harder? In my opinion, nope. They were actually no harder (and maybe even easier?) than the PP2 questions. As per my experience, ETS frames their questions in a certain way to make them look tricky. The actual work that needs to be put in is to get used to these question types (IMO). Hence, I would highly recommend sticking to just the ETS material (OG, quant practice guide, big book) even for quant. used the following resources to prepare for the test: AWA    - Gregmat Issue and Argument Essay videos
2. Verbal - Gregmat 1 month plan and **official ETS only** for practice
3. Quant - Manhattan 5lb book (good to get your basics in place), ETS material only I did use Magoosh as well for quant, but none of their hard/very hard questions showed up cannot stress on how helpful r/gregmat's strategies were for the verbal section. Anyone who is struggling with verbal and has at least a month or two to spare - please do not think twice. Greg's videos are probably the most invaluable resources out there for tackling the GRE verbal section - especially if you are a non-native English speaker like me.

I followed GregMat's 2 month plan. For quant I completed the 5lb Manhattan book, solved all the OG guide and quant reasoning book questions. For verbal, I went through Greg's sessions on TC, SE and RC. Solved all ETS guide questions. went through 840 words from Greg's list and 3-4 sets from the Magoosh App (a lot of overlap) scores:  - (152V 167Q) - (157V 162Q) - (157V 164Q) experience:** got VQVQV as my test format quant sections were very similar to PPP3 in terms of difficulty. I do not know about the difficulty of experimental sections that others might have come across but I was definitely hoping for a near perfect score as I come from a CS undergrad background.  verbal sections have always been the tougher ones for me, being a non native speaker. Although I knew a lot of the words in the TC and SE questions, the logic became difficult to comprehend. The pairing strategy works great for SE in my opinion. Although I will wait for my score report to see which questions I got wrong. The third verbal section was unusually easy leaving me confused as to which section was actually the experimental one as the first and second sections felt similar in terms of difficulty. you can see, I've never been able to cross the 160 barrier on verbal and I really wanted a near perfect quant score. I am considering retaking the GRE. Any advice on how to go about the next few weeks of preparation will be appreciated. I will be applying for MS in CS programs and those tend to get really competitive.

1,"I recently took the GRE after preparing for about 10-12  weeks. I went for the center-based test as I was apprehensive to take the at-home exam after reading the traumatic experiences of fellow Redditors. I got the QVQVQ format and the testing experience at the center was really smooth.  Quant, I mainly used the Manhattan 5lb book. Comparatively, I found the quant on the actual day of the test a bit easier. The questions that I found tricky were especially the Data related ones. I would suggest that having strong fundamentals in percent increase/decrease will help in avoiding traps. I found the other types of questions fairly straightforward. I would say that the current myth of increased quant difficulty is not true. I had a significant amount of time left, around 4-5 mins when I finished attempting all the questions. Check your answers again if you have extra time left. It is natural to make a silly mistake or two. I was able to correct one of the answers during the checking process. Verbal, all the credit goes to GREGMAT. His monthly subscription is totally worth it. Starting from the strategies to the shortcuts that he teaches, everything is process-oriented. This helped me in managing my time efficiently, and not being fazed during the test. I would say that the Vocab of the exam was not very complicated. I used Greg's list for my vocab preparation.  AWA I have helluva experience. Basically, I'm a procrastinator and pushed the AWA preparation till the last week. Even then, I wasn't completely dedicated to it. When I heard that Claim and Reasoning prompt was rare to encounter, I completely skipped it. Unfortunately, that was the one that I received during the exam. I was tensed for the first two minutes, then I just wrote the essay in my own improvised format. The argument essay was of medium difficulty, and I was satisfied with the way I wrote it. I would suggest dedicating at least 1-2 weeks for writing preparation.  practice tests is a must. I scored 330 (169Q, 161V)in PP1 and 329 (170Q,159V). But, I would say they are not sufficient. I wanted to practice the tests that have the experimental section. For this, I used Manhattan's practice tests. Practicing with an experimental section will help to get used to the pattern that you'll encounter on the test day. wish you all the best for your GRE exam. Be calm and focused during the test.

1,"Thought I'd share my experience as I've browsed this sub pretty regularly over the last year or so and have found it really helpful in offering various useful tips as well as a forum for commiseration. I was especially active here in between my two attempts as I was an anxious mess after seeing the 309 on my first attempt. This is a long post and is as much just me reflecting on my experience as it is trying to offer some insight for re-takers. I scored a 309 in early July and freaked out, altered my approach for 6 weeks, and scored a 320 yesterday, which was my goal from the start. Hopefully this can help any re-takers out there who are going through what I did over the last 6 weeks.  GRE scores** July, first attempt: 309 (V160 Q149) QVQVQ August, second attempt: 320 (V162 Q158) VQVQV Timeline** 1 - building a base* started studying August 2020 with the goal of sitting for the exam by November 2020. For various reasons (not feeling ready, pandemic uncertainties, i.e. not wanting to go to grad school virtually, being busier than usual at work, moving, etc., etc.,), I essentially stopped studying from December 2020 through March 2021. At this time I had taken the first two ETS practice tests, PP1 served as my diagnostic, on which I scored 304. In November I took PP2 and scored 310. Up until this time I had pretty much exclusively relied on Magoosh as my quant background is lacking and I needed to build a foundation. It was helpful for this purpose. I also found the flashcards helpful for verbal but supplemented with other materials in my second go around. I worked through about half of the quant sections in the Manhattan 5lb book. 2 - finding GregMat* got serious about studying again in April and studied 1-2 hours a day on weekdays and usually a bit more on weekends. During this time I watched every GregMat video on quant and most on reading/vocab. These were very helpful, but in hindsight, I wasn't spending nearly enough time on *actually doing problems.* From late April to late June I took PP3, PPP1, and PPP2, on which I scored 315, 320, and 313, respectively. Hmm, bit of inconsistency, I thought, but at the very least I should be good to expect a 315+ which was my minimum goal (my actual goal was 320 from day 1). In all of these scores, my verbal carried the total (think 163+ and a low 150s score in quant).  the test for the first time at this point. I discuss that below. 3 - prepping for second attempt* took two weeks off after my failed attempt. I went on vacation during this time and was mostly able to avoid thinking about the GRE, which was nice, but it was always in the back of my mind. When I got back I changed my approach. No more watching videos on quant topics and doing a couple problems and calling it a day. I studied for 2-3 hours a day on weekdays and up to 6 hours on weekend days. I was more intentional this time around - doing practice problems on a specific topic under timed restrictions, not just broad topics like ""geometry"", but more specific like ""arc and sector ratios"", for example. I also went through almost every SE and TC question on GRE Prep Club [here]( and continued studying vocab from a ton of sources (Magoosh, Gregmat, Barron's, quizlets I had created compiling words I didn't know from reading, etc.). The practice SE and TC questions helped a lot with identifying the logic structure GregMat talks about.  Attempt** off feeling rushed on my AWA and didn't feel confident in my essays at all. Oh well, hopefully not a precursor... not thrilled to have the first section be quant and know I'd have to go through 3 quant sections, which is by far my weakness. I was able to answer every quant question and felt pretty confident...until the third section. It felt like 4th grade math and I knew I was in trouble (thanks to having watched GregMat's overview video that explains how the sections work based on your scores). I got pretty nervous and heard Greg's voice over and over in my head throughout this section saying ""if you get an easy second section, you're gonna have to retake the GRE"". I tried to tell myself this easy section might be the experimental section, alas, Greg was correct. 149Q. Needless to say, I was devastated to see a total score of 309 - only 5 points higher than my diagnostic almost a year ago.  note: per my diagnostic, I got 6/20 on the first quant section and 18/20 on the second section. If my math is correct (wouldn't bet on it) the awful score on the first section resulted in a 5 point deduction. Pretty big deal and underscores the importance of getting at least that medium difficulty second section. great on the first verbal section. Ended up getting 17/20. The second section was **hard**. I didn't know half the words in the sentence equivalence questions and I usually breeze through these. 9/20 on this section, per diagnostic, which adds up to a 4 point bonus for getting this hard section.  I felt like I really experienced the highs and lows of the different levels of difficulty based on how you do on the first section of either Q or V. I didn't experience such drastic differences in any of the ETS practice tests, so maybe something to be aware of.  Attempt** felt a lot more confident in my AWA on this attempt, which I think helped get me into a better state of mind going into the meat of the exam. I didn't prep for AWA at all. As a former philosophy major who writes a lot for work I felt confident in this/didn't really care what I got since I know it isn't a big focus for the program I'm applying to. VQVQV helped my anxiety going into the test. Every verbal section felt like the same level of difficulty, which worried me since in my last attempt the second one was so much harder. I thought I might have underachieved in verbal, but ended up increasing my score by 2. For verbal I would do the SE and TC questions first and then do the RC's last.   quant section was standard and I was nervous to see the second quant section this time around since it was such an obvious indicator of my performance during my first exam. It felt very easy again and I pretty much resigned myself to a poor quant score, though I tried as hard as I could to push those thoughts out of my head. Waited a few minutes to hit ""report score"" so I could collect myself to see another score I wasn't proud of. Of course, I was thrilled to see the unofficial scores. I truly couldn't believe my eyes based on how easy that second section felt, but in hindsight it probably felt that way due to a mix of me overanalyzing the structure of the test based on my first attempt and going in with a better quant skillset the second time around.  with the GRE for good and excited to start thinking about other aspects of my application. I know this score wouldn't be great for a lot of you, but it was my goal and it feels that much better to have achieved it after what I scored the first time. The biggest thing I think I did differently was make my studying active instead of passive. On test day I worked out and ate a more complete meal prior to the exam. Two things I did not do the first time. Who knows if this made a difference. Took both in person.  luck to all re-takers! Try to keep those thoughts as positive a possible in-between tests. For me, it helped to remember that if I answered one or two more questions right on the first quant section I wouldn't have incurred that 5 point deduction and my ultimate score could've been much different.",309 six weeks ago to 320 yesterday.

I began studying for the AWA section about three weeks prior to taking the GRE.  I never had any of my essays graded until I took the official GRE General Test and saw my score.   was least worried about the quantitative section, so I just worked all of the math problems in the Official GRE study guide.  Additionally, I downloaded Magoosh and discovered that the math questions on the app are much more difficult than the book.  Becoming accustomed to answering hard math questions was certainly valuable.   was the most concerned about the verbal section because my vocabulary has never been great.  To prepare, I worked a few questions on Magoosh and I answered all of the questions in the Official GRE study guide book.   I studied on nights and weekends throughout the summer because I worked a full time job.  I was originally worried that I was not dedicating enough time to studying, but I no longer have those concerns.  I have a tendency to underestimate how well prepared I am for any given task.  My GRE Exam date was in early August.   Exams:   ever graded my essays until I got my official GRE score results, so I had no idea how well I would do.  On the quantitative section, I always got 170 on the practice Exams, but I usually had a few answers that I was unsure about.

1,"I gave the GRE offline, at a testing center, in Bangalore, India, last week. I got QVQVQ during the test, thankfully, as Quant has been my stronger section. I studied slowly - about an hour (or at max two) for a period of two months, with days where I wouldn't study at all. used GregMat strategies (only the free content on YouTube) for vocab strategies, these were extremely helpful, straight to the point and logical. I maintained a list of words I would come across that I did not know the meaning of, which I would go through often to ensure I knew the words. These words were taken from a variety of sources - GregMat's list (I didn't complete this in time - but I recommend you do), Magoosh apps (didn't complete this either), and some books/websites. quant has naturally been strong, and I was never too worried about it in the first place. There were formulas or properties I had forgotten that I needed to look up during my preparation, but to ensure I knew my quant well, I solved problems from the 5lb. Manhattan Prep Book. I also did some of the vocab sections in this book to get an understanding of the level, and though I know a lot of people do not recommend this book for verbal, I personally found it to be a good introduction to understanding the verbal section and level of complexity. gave three mock tests: 1: 321: 151V/169Q 2: 325: 159V/166Q 325: 158V/167Q experience itself was smooth - I was called the day before the test, from the testing centre ensuring I bring my original ID proof. The testing centre thoroughly checks you for any intent of malpractice. I was required to wear my mask the full way through the test. Scratch pads and pencils were provided constantly and immediately (when required). The analytical writing sections had interesting and fun themes, and I enjoyed writing for both the questions. My first quant section was on the easy-moderate section and I had time to finish questions and go through some of the trickier ones again. The second quant section was much harder, and I didn't have the time to solve two questions (one which was very easy but a little lenghty, unfortunately). The third quant was again on the easy-moderate level. I would classify both my verbal sections as moderate-hard, but since I am a non-native English speaker, this would differ from person-to-person.

But the second and third section of quants(don't know the experimental section) tricked me, like consumed much time of mine. And till date this is my worst score at least as per Manhattan Mocks(Paid 6 test's), Power Prep mocks and Kaplan. I had also taken Gregmat inorder to increase vocabulary score - after reading reviews on reddit, did practice from Big Book the TC, SE strategies nothing helped.(Had taken 2 month subscription). Is 2 month short duration or am I dumb for gre ? I could give an hour a day say during 2 month preparation due to work.(Manhattan mocks every Saturday just to get used to 4 hour exam timing.)
 this score help me get into good universities(top 50) ? I have written couple of research papers and a 9/10 cgpa in my undergrad and currently working as a SWE at an investment bank. aspired to get admitted into SBU, NCSU, UMass.
But seems this is now difficult. Can someone please state the Ambitious, Moderate and Safe on this score and also if I should reappear to improve my chances?","Should I retake gre V:147, Q:159 ?",1628692191,8,262,1
1,"Hi people of the GRE universe. took the GRE two days back and scored a disastrous 315 ( 153V, 162Q). I have been prepping on and off for GRE for 6 months now. I have a gregmat+ sub and magoosh sub as well. I also used the Manhattan 5LB, Big Book and ETS guides. I am a working professional so it was hard for me to balance my studying, but the last 15 days I studied for at least 8 hours a day. I have major exam anxiety ever since I was a kid. I freaked out after seeing my first RC question and verbal went downhill.  I have problem applying RC techniques because I'm scared of passages. Also I have a very small attention span so concentrating for full 20 questions back to back becomes hard for me. My quant has plateaued. It has never moved beyond 162 no matter what I do. Even if I see the questions before solving them I will still get at least 5 of them wrong. So what I am trying to so poorly articulate is that I need to pull this score up by a minimum of 10 points to get in a decent management program. I would really appreciate it, if you guys can help me out with what should be my next course of action. Should I get some courses or TTP or a GRE coach? Also for all the Indian people here, have you guys heard about top one percent by sandeep gupta. He claims to have a perfect gre score and 3 harvard admits. Is that coaching any good? advice is really appreciated.",Need to improve from a 315 to a 325+ in 1 month,1628687699,12,302,1

1,"Hey everyone, I took my test yesterday at home and scored 321 unofficial (Q 162 V 159). I am fairly satisfied with my score although I believe I could have increased my Quant score by approx 2 more points with around 2 more weeks of practice.  I might take it again sometime in Sept to improve my quant score. I faltered a bit after reading the Issue prompt because it was a bit odd and I couldn't think of good examples off the top of my head. The argument essay was smooth sailing and felt like I did really well on it (IMO it is the easier of the two essays) begin with, test day started really well for me and then took a turn for the worse. My internet stopped working about 5 hours before the test was supposed to start. Called my ISP and they said they would only be able to fix it by the next day. Nightmare. I had to call up my friend and finally set up my test area at his place and took it there. all this, the actual at-home test experience was extremely smooth with zero hiccups. The usual process happened before the test. ID Verification, 360-degree view of the room, showed the area under the desk,  used a mirror to show my computer screen, and showed where I kept my phone. The proctor asked me to reposition my desk such that the main door to my room was behind my back. I used one white sheet with a transparent sheet protector and had a couple of dry-erase pens. I left my room for a couple of minutes during the 10 min break and had to show a 360-degree view and my desk and under it after I came back. total prep time was around 1.5 months. Brushed up my quant using Magoosh Lessons and familiarized myself with the verbal section using Magoosh Lessons for around 3 weeks and decided to give a Magoosh Practice Test. Then, I analyzed my weak points and gave another practice test (not the magoosh practice test again because they are not very representative of the actual test) a week later. Repeated this for a total of 4 practice tests each separated by a week. **AWA:** Gregmat youtube videos, practiced 2 essays each on Magoosh (analyzed the sample responses and compared them to my response), and one scored AWA practice on Power Prep Plus.
* **Verbal Resources Used:**
   * Magoosh Vocabulary Builder (Common, Basic, and 3 out of the 7 Advanced Decks),
   * Used the ""Magoosh Complete Guide to Vocabulary"" ebook in the final week before the test to revise my vocab.
   * Solved tons of verbal questions on Magoosh using the 30 min verbal section test. I relied heavily on my reasoning skills for the verbal section too. GRE Verbal is also more of a reasoning test than a test of vocab.
* **Quant Resources Used:**
   * Magoosh Lessons to revise concepts or learn any new concepts/tricks on how to solve specific types of problems. 
   * Solved a few Magoosh quant questions but dropped them after realizing that they were a bit different from actual GRE quant questions.
   * Solved every question (all timed) on the ""ETS Offical GRE Quantitative Reasoning Practice Questions"" Book and analyzed my time-consuming areas and worked on those.
   * Solved the math diagnostic test and the three math practice sections at the end of the Manhattan 5 LB Book (all timed) and followed the same process of analyzing and working on weak areas. Management/Speed was the major issue for me in Quant (still was on the actual test day). I think an improvement on that will only come with more practice.

But I truly believe it was a different level of exam from what I prepared for and certainly a step up from even PPP3, which was the hardest of the practice. On exam day, I got the dreaded QVQVQ. There were so many tricky, time-wasting questions with no immediate shortcuts that were obvious to me. And it felt like I was guessing or marking every other question (except for the last section...sigh).  I guess my question is what’s next? Where can I best focus my time before the re-take?

 begin with, I would suggest everyone to give as many online mock tests as possible ( I gave Manhattan, Kaplan and Power Prep, in total 8 mock tests.) Mock tests helped me a lot in terms of getting acclimatized to the online format of the real GRE test and helped me with solving questions in time in front of the ticking clock on the screen. terms of the difficulty in the real GRE test, I would put it on par with both the Power Preps. Kaplan and Manhattan mocks are also close enough if not at par in terms of question difficulty with the real GRE test. had people telling me that quant in GRE was getting much trickier in recent weeks in comparison to earlier before I appeared for my test today. I didn't experience any such thing tbh. Quant was at the same level as in Power Prep. You would face the odd one or two tricky questions in each section, but that is expected. to verbal, it was not that tough. Barrons list and Magoosh flash cards covered majority of the words for me. I found only 3-4 new words in SE and TC questions of both sections. RCs were of medium level difficulty. I got one very long passage in my 1st verbal section.

Here's my overview of my prep and how much changed since I started. began preparing less than a month ago, where I tried a mock test from Manhattan prep. The prep I continued was in the same vein, a bunch of mock tests. The results were lacking, with a score of 310 (V154, Q156) With tips from u/scott_targettestprep my quant score did get boosted from 156 to 164 in 2 weeks, but in the official GRE, it fell to 160.

1,"Gave my GRE exam at a test centre today afternoon. The test had three quant and two verbal sections (Q-V-Q-V-Q). I am disappointed with my verbal score. Expected something closer to 159. Anyway, what's done is done.

  writing - The issue task was about universities requiring students to spend at least one semester in a foreign country. I responded by disagreeing with the statement. I adopted a structure similar to what u/GregMat details in his video. I think I did fairly well in both tasks. Expecting a score of 4.5 or 5.

  - Quant sections were fairly straightforward. Although, I would advise everyone to not solely rely on PP1 and PP2 to speculate the difficulty of questions. The questions in the actual are trickier and more time consuming, but you should be able to do fine with a solid understanding of basic concepts. The sole source of my preparation was the good old Manhattan 5lb. I felt that it is a great book for quant and would definitely recommend.

  - I personally found the verbal section to be harder than all the mocks I had taken. (PP1, PP2 and Manhattan). There were quite a few rare words and I think I did just well enough in the first section to not incur a penalty. Frankly disappointed with my score here since I has scores better in both powerprep tests (156 and 159). I would suggest everyone to go through GregMat's videos on verbal strategies and maybe even take up the premium subscription (which I hear is really really good). I discovered this a little too late to leverage in my preparation, but I would suggest it to others here as well. I used Manhattan 5lb and the GRE official guide for verbal, although I must admit that the test was harder than the questions in the official guide. I was also kind of worn out towards the end of the second verbal section, so that's on me.

  All in all, don't stress a lot. Make sure you're able to complete all sections with time to spare during your mocks. Manhattan 5lb is an excellent source. Please do choose to spend money on it. One month of good preparation can do wonders. Follow this community; I picked up a lot of valuable inputs from here. That's it. All the best!

1,"Thank you guys for all the help!  I’ve been lurking for the past week and the advice given here really helped to calm my nerves before the GRE :-) I’ll probably have to take the GRE again because my quant score isn’t high enough—for the program I want, verbal matters much less.  (I got the QVQVQ arrangement of the test and it was my worst nightmare; hoping that the second time I get VQVQV instead.  Fingers crossed!).  But I can offer some advice for first time test takers! the most important thing for me was going into it unprepared for a longer exam because of the experimental section.  The only practice test I’d taken that accurately simulated the time, accounting for the sixth section, was Kaplan— which I’ve heard isn’t the most accurate practice test.   I took that the day before the real thing and was absolutely exhausted by the end of Kaplan, and had a really bad headache.  If you’re doing practice tests or just problems from a book, try and select a quantity that corresponds to doing an additional experimental section to build stamina! important, moreso for quant, is the virtue of skipping problems and returning to them later.  Sometimes a problem doesn’t click in your head the first time around, and that’s totally OK!  The smarter decision is often to let it go for a while and come back to it.  This helps a lot with time. :-) for verbal, I honestly am surprised by my score.  The two sections I had were pretty easy and I completed them both with 10 minutes to spare at the end.  I mostly used the sections to decompress before quant and rest my eyes— I think I got lucky and got some easier verbal sections, because in practice tests (power prep 1 and 2 + Kaplan), I was getting consistent 167’s.  Anyway, my advice is primarily to be wary of inserting anything into the sentences/passages that isn’t already there.  Don’t make assumptions since there’s always a trap answer that seems reasonable, but ultimately is beyond the scope of what the author is arguing.  
As for the vocabulary, it was pretty straightforward!  Studying Magoosh (I think I memorized decks 1-2) and the words in ETS’s official book + the power prep tests was sufficient preparation.  There are some words you of course will not know, but as long as you know most of the others in the same question, it’s possible to get it right. context/background, I studied for the GRE for about 3 weeks, starting with a thorough math review from ETS’s official website— then the ETS practice book— then Manhattan’s practice book— then a variety of practice tests (167 consistently on verbal, 163-170 on quant).  I have a disability but didn’t have proper accommodations for the test, which combined with the awful and very tiring QVQVQ, really did me in on the quant.  Good luck to everyone studying!!

I am aiming for 165 atleast and will give my gre most likely in 20-25 August

So how much i can expect in that too ? Or 
This prep test is not that accurate??

• Associate words with pictures while learning words. Try to keep image very clear in your mind.
• Practise for the weaker sections in your quants. Solve as many questions as you need.
• Get r/gregmat 's one month plan if you can. I could not, but would have loved to have that in my arsenal.
• Have a cool mindset. I basically played games for last two days. Don't even touch your books. Clean up everything and just enjoy.
• Have a little bit of snacks in your 10 min break. (suggestion Snickers)

1,"After a failed attempt when I was turned away at the testing centre because of “ets maintenance/updating” I’m finally done!  International student, first language English I started with a diagnostic test after math concept review then moved on to Manhattan 5LB. After that I started Gregmat’s 1 month plan to prepare. I also did all the official GRE material (quant, verbal, general book &amp; maybe up to test 6-7 on big book). For mock tests I did 3 timed - PP1, PP2 and PPPLUS3 (I also did the other PPPLUS questions as found on the chinese website). 
I had an error/vocab log for all the questions/words I got wrong/wanted to review.  I started out with magoosh’s vocab app (I gave all of the words including Advanced at least a cursory read-through) and gregmat’s word list (I thought the quizzes he did - on yt and on his website were super helpful). Strategy wise Gregmat’s SE &amp; RC ones really helped me. 
General tips for verbal would be to “actively” read the passages - for me it helped to take down notes because it forced me to focus on what I was reading (but I do admit it’s quite time consuming so it might not be for everyone).  Manhattan 5LB then just official material and some gregmat advanced questions. For quant I think the one thing that really helped is actively looking for the “tricks” ETS has (especially in QC) - for e.g when testing numbers check +\- AND fractions to be sure etc (read the logic/explanations for questions to make sure you don’t miss any traps)  Started with gregmat’s AWA videos &amp; other than that I did essay outlines (3 each/day for maybe 2 weeks). Which ended up paying off because I had encountered my test day issue prompt during prep.  practices:
Diagnostic (PP1) : 163V/166Q
(For the week or so before my actual exam I did 2 practices)
PP2: 163V, 170Q

I got a call the day before to arrive 1 hour before my test and when I arrived I had to hand over my ID. They gave me a locker to put my belongings and after the security checks I was allowed in. I was given scrap paper &amp; a pen (you can do a one for one exchange for more paper too). 
The actual test was exactly like the PowerPrep ones I did down to all the small breaks so it’s helpful to do at least 1 to familiarize yourself with the interface. I got VQVQV &amp; I’m pretty sure my first V was the research section (one of the passages for that was just ridiculously long which lead to me barely finishing that section). To me the Q sections were tougher than the practices/my expectation (maybe it’s just test day anxiety), the QCs were tricky &amp; there were a few Qs that stumped me (skipping those and coming back really helped - I had time left to check on both) it’s been a whirlwind experience tackling this whole thing alone, but this page &amp; the greprep one have been very helpful throughout.

1,"Hi everyone, took the GRE on Sunday 25th July 2021 and scored V-148 Q-166 and AWA score yet to come(Mostly expecting a 4.0-4.5). This was my second attempt,I gave the exam in Feb and got the dreaded QVQVQ,  and scored V-145 Q-163 AWA-4.5 . This time I got VQVQV and breathed a sigh of relief. In my last attempt the first quant was experimental and had some weird questions. The 2nd quant was okay and the 3rd quant was very difficult. The 2nd quant section had a difficulty level of 3.3 and the the 3rd quant section had a difficulty level of 4.1. My time management in the last attempt was very poor as well. I had a 16/20 in the first section and 13/20 in the second. The problems in the 3rd section were very wordy and felt like GMAT advanced questions tbh .Now coming to the recent attempt, I managed to increase my quant score by 4 points. This time , I had prepared well and was much better in managing time this time. I followed GregMat's strategy  to attempt the quant section( Attempt 8-20 first and then in the last 10-12 min attempt the QC's) in both the attempts. Now I'll give a brief summary about the quant sections this time.  1- Was a breeze , no out of the box questions were asked and they were very similar to the ETS material( Big Book, PP , PPP , Official guide and Quant questions book). Although I made two errors which were very silly. The question asked give your answer to the nearest million ( I forgot to round that off) and the second error was due to shortage of time I guess(It was a question on  Circle Arcs and Inscribed Octagon), the equation came as 180=2x+45 and I marked the option of 65 instead of 67.5 as there were only 10 seconds left on the timer. 2- Was also surprisingly a breeze. I felt like I did badly on the first section but the score says otherwise. All questions were very straightforward. I managed to finish 19 questions in 31 minutes leaving 4 minutes for a weird probability question(which I realized later was a very easy question also). The probability question was a question on probability distribution and I couldn't recall the same during the test. takeaways- Earlier I felt that the quant has gotten tougher , but I guess I felt like that due average prep and  poor time management earlier I couldn't do my best  Stick to ETS as much as possible. You can get 160+ in Quant just by sticking to ETS material.

 3) Enroll in gregMat+ , that guy is just a god Make sure to do the Manhattan 5lb advanced quant , some similar questions might appear Do the GMAT advanced quant questions if you have time, As they can help you hold your nerves in case of weird experimental quant. I saw some wordy questions in the 3rd section of Quant myself that came from the GMAT book VQVQV &gt;&gt;&gt; QVQVQ anyday. Just pray for some luck that you get 3 verbal sections instead of 3 quant sections Enroll for Manhattan test series, Although they may have weird verbal and quant sections.  But they have an experimental section and that is a huge plus point Also don't forget to the PPP1,2,3 quant questions as they resemble the actual test Combinatorics and Probability are really non existent(I had only one probability question). Focus more on mean, median and mode, weighted averages, overlapping sets and charts as they comprise more weightage than any other section the best for your G-Day",GRE Experience,1627717625,2,676,1

 My observations: I probably didn't require so much time but I couldn't study on many of the weekdays due to work and had to make sure I get a 165+ quant score. I have seen many posts here suggesting how vocab is not as important. In my experience however it is most important, especially for a non-native speaker like me. Knowing most of the words on the screen, I could manage to finish TC/SEs in 10 minutes and dedicate the remaining time to RCs. Don't just memorise vocab word meanings, but actually spend time on each word. Study the etymology and synonyms for every word. Stick with your test strategy. Do not change your strategy during the actual GRE. This is where I messed up, wasted time double checking every question on the easy quant section and could not finish the section in time (2 questions left out). Could have scored atleast 168Q. Use Magoosh for quant and only ETS for verbal. Only the ETS tests are representative of the actual GRE.

1,"So I started my journey with the GRE in September last year. I am mostly focused on quant because I'm applying for a Data Science master (my degree is un business administration).

My weakness was when the questions started to be ""hard"" and ""devilish"" (reference to Manhattan). In January I took the test and got a 156Q 150V. I was devastated because I need a minimum of 160Q and 150V, but in the practice tests (Manhattan) always got between 156 and 159. So now I focused more on practicing math and verbal (vocabulary and techniques). Now I get between 161 and 164 in quant (Two 161 Manhattan, one 161 Princeton and 164 in Princeton) but is without time. Now I know that the time is one big factor in my failure from the start of the year plus the ""hard"" and ""devilish"" experiences. What can I do to improve being faster with this kind of ""devilish"" and ""hard"" problems?

In my mocks I was consistently scoring =&gt;165 in Quant so this score just saddens me. 
I believe the questions were just lengthy and I couldn't revise in any of the quant sections and couldn't solve a total of 4 questions... I'm assuming that the rest of the score was probably due to silly mistakes. 
For quant prep I just did questions from Manhattan 5lb and did all the ETS questions thoroughly just to understand what they like to test. It was just not my day though for quant. couldn't assess the experimental section of verbal: they were all equally levelled. In the mocks leading up to my exam, I had been getting about a similar verbal score. Initially when I started out, it was around 150 so tips from gregmat did help me considerably!

I couldn't sit for a long time in one place and had to lie down after long tests. It was also triggered by anxiety in that in my verbal sections the pain used to get excruciating. In the last week I started meditating to relax myself of the anxiety because this pain was just very worrisome and I didn't know if I could even sit for a 4 hour long exam irl. I didn't feel the pain even once during my exam(I felt it a lot in my mocks as well) and I think that's a much bigger achievement for me: to go through all the sections stress free calmed my nerves thankfully. good luck guys!

1,"So I gave the GRE two days back in a center and it went pretty well. I was targeting a perfect score in quant and 160+ in verbal, but 168 was a pleasant surprise. However, it's unofficial so I don't want to jinx it.  🤞 Here are some of the tips and tricks that I'll like to share.  
 come from an engineering background so quant was all about revising the basics and not making any silly mistakes. In case you are in the same boat, I highly suggest using the official Math review as it has the basic theory and ample problems for brushing up your skills. One more advantage is that you'll get an idea of the GRE syllabus. It's important to know what techniques ETS expects you to use because otherwise you might start applying advanced stuff like trigonometry without realizing that it is not even required. In case you need to prepare well for a particular topic, Manhattan 5 lb is a good option. section requires good time management because you surely want to have some time to go over your answers and look for any silly mistake. You definitely don't want to lose any mark just because of some brain-fade.  with verbal prep is tricky because there is little point in attempting practice questions when you don't know half of the words. That's why starting with improving your vocab is essential. Magoosh app is a lifesaver when it comes to vocab. I went over common and basic sets and they should be enough. Remember that trying to learn advanced words might backfire as we can only retain a set amount of info over a period of time. You don't want to unlearn the more important words just to know a few fancy ones. GregMat's quizzes on YT are also a good way to prepare for vocab. After you are done with a fair deal of vocab, start practicing using a resource like Manhattan 5 lb. I haven't received my AWA score yet, I'll go ahead and say that GregMat videos are the best resource for this section, followed by the official ETS guide. Greg has provided a great structure for both issue and argument essays, and it should be good enough to score a decent score. From what I have read on the internet, a high score in AWA may not help much but a low score will harm your profile, so it's better to play it safe and approach the essays with a structured format. This is exactly why I do not recommend reading the sample essays given in Manhattan 5 lb. They are very well-written but it's going to be really difficult for a non-native speaker to reproduce something like that in 30 minutes. tests**: mock tests is important because giving an exam for more than 3 hours is not a trivial task. Some of the free resources I found are: 2 PowerPrep tests by ETS
2. 10 Kaplan tests on the Chinese website (the argument essay doesn't show up and there is no experimental section)
3. 4 tests on Princeton Review (you need to register using the ISBN number of their book which you'll find on the net; this one also grades the AWA section)
4. 2 paper-based tests in the Princeton book

I bought all the official ETS material but haven’t touched it yet (will get to it next as I know that this material is gold). Also, after going over the questions I got wrong, it seems like I gave up about 2 questions per each of the four sections due to running out of time. It’s likely that I could have gotten these questions correct if I gave myself more than 5 seconds… I missed almost all of the sentence equivalence questions in both verbal sections as well, and I heard that these are the easier questions to improve on after you learn the correct technique.

2) Make an appointment only when you're absolutely sure that you're ready (I booked mine on 20th).. because many exigencies like weather, traffic etc (especially in Monsoon) can affect your internet speeds.
3) On Test day, ensure your seating area is clear of unnecessary stuff &amp; Door is visibly shut to Proctor.
4) Login everyday prior to test &amp; perform Equipment Check with ProctorU.
5) For quicker &amp; successful checkin, keep your cellphone &amp; passport ready and while capturing images make sure they align properly with display borders.

1,"Hello, have the Manhattan 5lb book and I just took the quant diagnostic test.  Question #4 gives a triangle (general shape below, but the actual question isn't on a graph and so the coordinates of A, B, and C aren't given at all) and asks whether the slope of Line Segment AB is greater than, less than, equal to, or of indeterminate relationship to the slope of line segment AC:

 put ""D"" which is indeterminate, but the answer is actually B.  So here's my question:  The one big takeaway I have from standardized tests is that you CANNOT assume that any of the figures, etc. are drawn to scale (unless you have hard data, numbers, etc.).  But with this question, I totally get why the answer is B if you generally assume that the figure is pretty close.  But really, unless you make some assumptions about scale, I don't see why the answer isn't D. if you have a triangle that looks generally like the diagram, B makes sense.  But if all you know is that A is in Q3, and B and C are in Q1, and you generally know which quadrants the X and Y intercepts are in... shouldn't you HAVE to assume that the triangle could be any shape that conforms to those rules? For example, couldn't the triangle be shaped like this:

 the slope of AB is much greater than the slop of AC? conversely, couldn't it be shaped like this:

 the slope of AC is much larger than the slope of AB?  Both of the above two triangles follow all of the rules that were set out and can be determined (quadrants, intercepts, etc.).  The only things that change are the coordinates of A, B, and C, which aren't given and so should be flexible. I guess a few things could be happening here: maybe I'm totally misunderstanding the problem maybe I'm just an idiot about slope and stuff; or maybe there's kind of a logical limit about how many assumptions you can make?  Like, if the triangle in the original question is even generally kind of drawn to a reasonable scale, I see why the answer is B if you don't majorly distort the triangle.  But I also kind of thought that part of the GRE was being able to majorly distort shapes and still have the question work. 4) maybe I'm just missing something else!  But I'm very lost here and so any explanation would be super useful.  Thanks!",Question on Manhattan Prep 5lb book Quant Diagnostic #4?,1626984965,11,491,1

Lastly, I cannot forget to thank that one very special person (my study mate who I found on Reddit) who stood by me for all these months, practiced with me daily, and motivated me along this incredible journey. Thank you very much if you're reading this. background: an engineer working in consulting, works hours are not specified but goes up to 10-11pm at night. Work interrupted my progress a lot. Started preparing around April with my study buddy, and scheduled my exam in the last week of May. Overall, it took 3 months of prep (would have been shorter factoring my work hours) experience (VQVQV): Had to wait for an hour before the exam started due to a technical glitch. The administrator made use wait outside, and I was drenched in sweat by then -.- Essays: Quite good. Had some time in the end to check for any mistakes.
2. Verbal:
   1. Sentence equivalence: Guys, the pairing strategy works!!
   2. TCs and RCs: Found myself flummoxed, but somehow managed to get some right. Can't say much of the difficulty, close to what I saw in the Big Book.
3. Quant:
   1. First section: Was able to solve all questions with 6 minutes remaining for cross-checks. It was a mixture of easy and hard ones.
   2. Second section: Damn, really challenging ones. Definitely, the difficulty was on the higher end, nothing compared to ETS OG. Many were very difficult and tedious as I saw around 5-6 questions related to percentiles, probability and counting problems. DI was time-consuming here. Essays: Just go with Greg's videos on YouTube. You won't find any other resource as good as his. Started around end of June, wrote around over 10 of them to gauge my speed and word count.
2. Verbal: ETS OG, big book and GREGMAT subscription!! I regret starting this in June, should have begun with verbal in April.
3. Quant: ETS OG, Manhattan 5lb, and Magoosh hard &amp; very hard problems.
4. Vocab: I started off with Vince's Cartoon app, but lost progress due to change of device. Started with Greg's 28 sets on Quizlet and Ed's WordsWithGIFs for better visualization. Don't forget to go through the synonyms Google Sheet made by Greg.  little tip for anyone with specs, try using contact lens on the day of the exam, the mask causes fogging of your specs from time to time. as Greg says, ""It is a game"".

1,"Hello I am a 3rd year (almost 4th year) student who's going to attempt the GRE test for the first time on August 4th. I'm already positive there have been an endless stream of such posts but I have been slow to realize that the test is only in a few weeks and I'm currently too nervous to concentrate on anything.  quarantine has ruined my sense of timing and what just felt like a few months has turned into more than a whole year. My GRE practice schedule has honestly been pretty lackluster, with the occasional hour of practice per one or two weeks. A year ago I decided to capitalize on the quarantine to improve my GPA which turned out to be a gambit with only limited success: I did not improve my skills in coding or GRE. My parents were understandably unhappy with my routine and forced a date upon me to attempt gre and chose August 4th. I was very unwilling because I was sure my university would inconveniently postpone my finals to around that date, which obviously ended up happening, and is further making me scared, besides GRE. Now I have to balance studying for my finals and practicing GRE.  I'm typing this post in the hopes of gaining tips that could drastically improve my chances of doing good in gre. I have tried 2 practice tests in the last month, from Manhattan prep, and I don't know how accurately it simulates the actual gre test. In the first one, I scored V:156 Q:158. In the second one, I scored V:150 Q:158. I'm expecting this to be an easier representation of the real test which is concerning, as these scores are extremely average, and I turn to you folk to please help me get better somehow. There are only 2 weeks I can spend on practicing, but I honestly don't know how far practicing can get me. From the results of these mock tests, I know my verbal score is lacking but I'm more anxious for the quantitative part, because I can't seem to avoid making ridiculously silly errors. I don't know anyone who is taking the GRE anytime soon, I kindly request for any tips for me to improve, and in only 2 weeks. Is there also any way to keep track of every major math topic that gre covers? Please pass on your advice here, I am grateful for any useful input from you all.

8. PP1 - Score 335: V169 &amp; Q166 Comments: I'm sure you have already deduced, while it can be a + or - 5 indicator for the official exam, it does not feel like the actual GRE in any way. It feels much easier. The verbal is similar, but the math on the real GRE is harder and more intimidating. Be prepared for the difference in feeling and embrace it.  note, I did not want to pay for the PowerPrep Plus 1, 2, or 3, and I did not want to psych myself out by taking the PowerPrep 2 Exam.  Overview: test was QVQV. I did not encounter an experimental section, unless I blacked out during that portion of the exam. However, I do not believe that was the case.  I found myself struggling to complete the Issue Essay, but I did not have a problem with the Argument Essay.  1: This felt slightly harder than the PP1 Quant, but it was reasonable and not stressful. 2: Trigger Warning (Don't Panic) - This section was utterly ridiculous, and it felt so much harder than I ever imagined. I found myself running out of time, and I was forced to guess on a write-in problem. I imagine this was the hard quant section, and being weaker at quant, I definitely felt it.  3: N/A 1: Verbal felt just like the PP1, but I did encounter words that I had not seen previously, even with a notable amount of vocab practice.  2: I noticed a slight difficulty increase, but it was marginal at best. Again, I encountered a couple words that I had to make educated guesses on. Additionally, I found myself getting distracted while reading the RC problems.  Opinions: I was skeptical about the quant difficulty increase, and I'm still not sure if the GRE Quant has gotten harder overall. However, I can say with confidence that there is a gigantic curve from the medium section to the hard section. In respect to PP1, the difficulty was definitely a shock when compared with the hard portion of the exam. However, PP1 was still on par with the medium section. It is important to note that the 5Lb book problems felt more like the medium section than the hard section. Definitely do the advanced quant section in the 5Lb book. 
2. The GRE was a difficult exam, but, all the topics can be studied and you can improve your scores.  Do not be discouraged by one bad score. Keep trying, practicing, and analyzing your mistakes. Within this vein, make sure you give yourself an adequate amount of time to prepare. I recommend 2-3 hours per day for 2-3 months. If you are working a 9-5 job, that may be extremely difficult, so you'd want to space that time out over the course of several more months. However, if you space it out too much, you run the risk of forgetting previously learned material, so stay consistent if you can only devote a shorter amount of time per day.  Recommendations: Study (Obviously). For most people, including myself, this is not an exam that you can just walk into if you want to do well. The quant is tricky, especially if you make it to the hard section, and if you are not already inclined towards the verbal section, you MUST study vocab. Vocab is important even for reading comprehension on the GRE. Additionally, I would make sure that you practice writing a few argument and issue essays before jumping into the exam. You need to have a template and formula down, so you can write everything in time.
2. Use as many free resources as you can, excluding books (Buy them)! Free is your friend. However, despite not having paid for it myself, I imagine Gregmat's subscription is quite helpful, so if I was going to purchase anything in addition to books, I would buy that.    luck to everyone taking this exam!

1,"Yesterday I took the GRE general test at a testing centre in my country. Overall testing experience was fine. I didn’t want to risk having the internet connection drop or distracting background noise with the At Home test. as a disclaimer before you keep reading, I am NOT 100% happy with my score as I really want above 320. I would have cancelled my test yesterday if it were not for a close approaching deadline to my #1 preference uni. So I will be doing another round of study 📚 and take the test in September to apply to my backup schools, just in case my number one doesn’t work out** got QVQVQ and the quant was fine. The verbal was also GREAT for the first section (I was super confident about that), but then the second verbal section felt like an entire guessing game. So I don’t know what happened there.  prep started last year for ~2 weeks solid on Greg Mat+ one month plan. I didn’t write down my diagnostic score but I think I remember it being around 305 with really low quant. I stopped studying after 2 weeks because I was also busy applying for internships and soon after a (finance) internship took over my life. That job only ended in early June of this year. other scores were:
PP2: (2nd time round Diagnostic - May 16 2021)
Quant: 152
Verbal: 157 Based I
Quant: 153
Verbal: 153 Based II:
Verbal: 154
Quant: 155 Prep Plus 1 (I took this a week ago)
Quant: 149
Verbal: 157
AWA:  really struggled with timing for both sections so GregMat’s timing strategy sections were god sends. However, the quant timing strategy used in PP1 didn’t quite work out - I tried skipping the QCs and as you can see my 149Q had me devastated and anxious a week before my test. I usually get the QCs right and struggle with the multi choice in the middle. For my real test I didn’t skip the QCs first and my scores were much better!
That being said, learning to skip questions was 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼. Learning not to get attached to questions really helped me with my timing and I am pretty sure that’s the top reason my quant score rose.  test prep was unfortunately sporadic during the month of June this year, when I started. I also had uni exams, a major scholarship application/ interview/ exam due (which I passed!). I managed to knuckle down the last couple weeks but unfortunately that was not enough. I did 8 sets of GregMat’s vocab list, some Magoosh vocab, and a lot of ETS official guide practice questions + going over my wrong answers.
 I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY NEXY TIME wish I had watched Greg’s “what to do 1 week before the test” 1.5 months before my test. He mentioned that a lot of 160s or high 150s have a lot of “quant holes” to fill and he mentioned Khan Academy. I then discovered ALL of ETS’s quant concepts on Khan Academy with practice questions. Amazing. Wish I had done that a LONG time ago! Anyway, I filled some holes in my last week, but I knew I had a few more holes left un-filled. I didn’t practice verbal at all since my target programme is much more quant heavy and that was more important. will start studying in a week’s time after sorting out a lot of life admin that has been piling up, and I will definitely go back to Khan Academy, order the Manhattan 5Ib book, and finish the seasons of GregMat’s dedicated reading at TC videos. I plan to spend 1-2 hours a day for 2 months, or 100 hours over the next two months. I also have a few Economist magazines lying around, plus books, so I will be making an effort to ACTIVELY read them (unfortunately this is not as fun as normal reading, but I hope the habit of doing so will pay dividends for the rest of my life). will also spend a lot more time doing timed practice questions, since I feel like timing was a huge barrier for me and still is.

1. Watched every single magoosh math lesson video
2. Solved every single problem, could get 100% correct in easy and medium, hard was 90+% correct, very hard was 60+% correct. Spent a lot of time looking at the answers understanding how problems were solved, where I went wrong, what mistakes I was repeating.
3. I spent a lot of time just getting number sense right. Which meant giving my self random scenarios and playing with math while driving in my head.

1,"I gave my GRE a few days back and ended up with 166Q 167V. realise that there's a constant debate about whether quant is getting harder or not, and IMO, I'd say there is a chance you end up with a harder quant section than you expect. had a lot of folks breeze through their Quant in the last few days as well, so it definitely doesn't seem like an absolute trend that the Quant is getting harder, but at least for me, it was hard enough for me to not be able to differentiate it from the experimental section. had QVQVQ and was pretty sure that my first Quant was experimental because of 2-3 weird graph questions, but this changed quickly when I saw the second Quant. While there certainly wasn't any question that was out of syllabus so to speak, most questions were really verbose and had a long paragraph to explain what was going in the question. It was a series of things happening in the question and you had to extract the relevant information and collect the information accordingly. This obviously makes it a lot more time consuming. Additionally, the graph questions were not nearly as straight forward as the ones in PP1/2 or the Manhattan 5lb. The values weren't nice to work with, and I really had to read the question 2-3 times to get a grip of what they wanted exactly. this to the test day anxiety, and it definitely made the Quant section harder than what I thought it would be. PP scores were:
PP1 - 167Q 164V
PP2 - 168Q 161V used the GregMat + subscription and usually don't have a problem with the Medium/Hard Quant questions since I have a relatively robust Mathematical background as a CS undergrad; so the Quant was definitely a bit of a surprise for me, more because I wasn't expecting it. again, this is just my personal opinion and maybe it goes well for everyone else. :)",My experience with the GRE Quant,1625541912,6,365,1

1,"Wrote the exam at the center. Was too scared of something going wrong at home with regards to my internet. Had absolutely no issues. I just wish they would allow water inside :( QVQVQ. Pretty sure my first section was the experimental one. After decent essays, I was off to a good start, but absolutely got my ass handed to me on the 1st quant section. The questions were **quite** lengthy (but not difficult; unfortunately, in quant time is everything), and that led to me panicking and continuously thinking I was messing up big time. This also affected my mental for the rest of the test, until the last quant section started going well, which is when I realized the 1st section was probably the experimental one. I didn't expect it to be the first one hahahaha.  Followed Mr. Gregmat's 1 month plan, and took about a month and a half to finish it (even after watching every video at 2x). It is a very good plan, but I wish now that I had started Gregmat+ earlier and done the 2 months plan instead. Regardless, both are very, very good. It was hard to manage in a month as I had a full time internship going on, but I pulled through. studied about 3 to 4 hours/day on average, spaced out throughout the day, in bursts of maybe 40 mins.  I intend do a course that doesn't require very high verbal scores, this part was not very important to me, but it's where I spent most of my time. I knew that even though I didn't have to ace the verbal part, I still needed a decent score so my overall doesn't fall too much. I am a non native speaker, therefore verbal was not as easy to me as it might be to some others. But, I have been speaking English throughout my education, thus it wasn't way too hard either. My biggest weakness was my vocabulary. Having been an avid reader since my childhood, I thought I had a fairly good vocab, but that was until I started going through the words lists (Gregmat 30 \* 28 words). I wrote down each word in a notebook by hand, going 1 set a day, and would write small mnemonics of words that I had heard for the 1st time. I would revise these once about every three or four days. I don't think I will be forgetting these words anytime soon.  there were various words on the test that I still wasn't 100% sure of, especially in my 2nd verbal section, SE questions. This is where the pairing strategy wasn't very helpful to me, but the fault is my own for not having a huge vocab, the strategy is very good.  I also felt I did okay on the TC and perhaps lost most of my marks on the RC :/ The questions were a bit difficult and tricky, harder than PP1 and 2. I wish I had scored maybe two more and gotten 160, but it is what it is. Improve your vocab!! Mr. Gregmat's videos got me to where I reached. I was getting 148-150 about 3 months ago.

I already know I've lost all my marks due to missing out on some smaller details in the question, or perhaps forgetting to consider some possibility. The PP1 and 2 questions are a bit misleading. The actual quant is harder than them. I did do some practice from the 5lb book, which I would recommend.  Also, PP Plus has good questions. While I did not give that test, I found the questions from there on reddit itself. I wish I would have practiced more from there to possibly avoid the silly mistakes I made. I was hoping I would reach 165, but having not reached that on either pp1 or 2, I knew it would not be easy. Am I satisfied with my 163? Yes and no.

I have 35 days until my actual test. I did really well on the first Verbal (17/20) but got tripped up on the second one with vocab (8/20), so I know I need to work on my vocab and context clues. was kind of rough (14/20, then 11/20), and it honestly felt overwhelming like either I didn't know the question being asked or like I had not seen the format before. I worked through the ETS Quant book and am now doing Manhattan practice, but it almost feels like those aren't really representative of the test. questions are as follows: Should I just focus on doing every PowerPrep Quant question I can find then pivot to Manhattan, so I make sure I familiarize myself with ETS' way of asking questions/presenting them?

I was pretty nervous considering the horrifying experiences I had heard about, but touchwood, the test went smoothly without any impediment, and I got my score report soon.  got a QVQVQ, which was something I had wished for.  would like to thank GregMat (u/gregmat), Vince Kotchian (u/Vince\_Kotchian) and Scott (Scott\_TargetTestPrep) for all the guidance provided on this thread and their resources as well.  strategies provided by GregMat and his old GRE walkthrough videos are the best material you'll find on GRE tutoring. He also has some tools: The Big Book Index, The Random Essay Generator, and the GRE-like Calculator which come in handy while practicing.  respect to the Big Book, the Text Completion questions are good to start with but are easier as compared to the New GRE in terms of sentence structure. Big Book is the best practice material available for Reading Comprehension Passages. When it comes to Critical Reasoning, almost all the questions are quite simpler than the Real New GRE.  fact that GregMat has provided so much material only for 5$ a month, makes him an angel for us GRE candidates, **THANK YOU GREG.**

1,"Let me preface by saying, I had to unjoin this community for a couple of months. Constantly seeing people score 320+ was making me depressed because I thought I was smart too, albeit maybe not that smart. did three tests so far, &amp; the results are as follows: = (151Q/155V) 4.5 AWA = (153Q/154V) 4.0 AWA (Today) = (160Q/158V) Pending AWA into my first test, I had been performing well on Kaplan tests &amp; the Manhattan Big Book. I got to the first test &amp; the math was WAY harder than I anticipated. I thought the level of difficulty would be equivalent to the free PowerPreps on the GRE site, WRONG!  went back to the drawing board after using the GRE diagnostic tool to see where I made errors &amp; purchased Magoosh! I was using it &amp; getting a lot of the Hard/Very Hard quant questions wrong. I consistently wrote down my errors in an error log to see where I was making mistakes. For verbal, any words I came across that I did not know I took it down on cue cards; by my 3rd test I had 114 cue cards with 10 words each &amp; I would go through \~30 a day. I got these words through a mix of Barrons, Manhattan Big Book Verbal Questions (Prior to doing the questions I wrote down the definitions of words I did not know), &amp; general reading.  weeks later, I attempted the test for the 2nd time &amp; got an argument essay that gave me a mental block &amp; it destroyed my essay percentile this go around. I thought I was doing well on the math, but the GRE diagnostic indicated otherwise. The lone bright spot on my test, Verbal, really wasn't a bright spot because I regressed in SE &amp; TC by 1 question each, respectively. I was really down on myself because I could do questions in practice &amp; studied day in/day out. It just wasn't working out. ended up reading some Reddit posts via Google &amp; it highly recommended ETS Official Materials. I focused on the Official Materials, used Manhattan's Verbal Guide for my RC strategies &amp; practiced the Hard/Very Hard TC/SE on Magoosh. I took the test today, my third attempt, &amp; this time around I got an immense amount of anxiety. I was remembering someone on here who said, "" Don't do the test more than twice because after that your scores plateau. "" That comment had me doubting whether I should reconsider post-graduate education. the test was fair in Quant, but I felt the 2nd verbal section ratchet up in difficulty. One of the RC passages was super wordy &amp; I felt like I was making educated guesses to arrive at the answers. Otherwise, I was elated when the numbers went across the screen. I think I reclaimed my high scores in AWA because my essays were on point. Tips: You may have to take the test multiple times &amp; that is okay. We are not perfect. We may get a question assortment that is just not for us. This can result in us getting scores that are not COMPLETELY reflective of our ability. Let me caveat that by saying, the test result is reflective of you for that problem set, but not for EVERY problem set native to the GRE. Take the test until you find YOUR problem set. Find some books you like &amp; read them every day I love crime novels &amp; I would love to become successful one day to the point I could write something popular. As a result, it was easy reading crime novels &amp; finance-related topics to maintain a baseline reading speed. Could I have read old English literature &amp; scientific studies to be more test-ready? Yes, but I decided to leave that for practice questions instead. Worry about your own progress  Everyone has their own baseline. A person in Kansas may not have had the same mathematical background as someone in Michigan-- &amp; that is perfectly reasonable. At the end of the day, control the factors you can control. Not everyone had the same upbringing, strengths, &amp; educational aptitude as you; to combat that, compare your progress to yourself &amp; not people on Reddit that post their successes to remind you of what a failure YOU think you are. Self Selection Bias is REAL You may have outperformed in high school. You may have outperformed in university. But can you outperform everyone on a global scale? That is what this test comes down to. You are not only competing with people from your city. Instead, you are up against people from around the world. Once you account for that, no wonder smart people feel sad when they experience underperformance. You are literally competing against the smartest people at their respective universities from around the world. Luck Everyone!

1,"Hi, took the GRE yesterday and I didn't get the results I was expecting (I was aiming near 168Q and I get 164Q).  experience with ProctorU wasn't the best. I had my desk perfectly prepared for the test, using my laptop and a external monitor, with the lid closed and a gopro as a external camera to show my walls easily. But the proctor told me the monitor wasn't permited, and the gopro focus made difficult to show my ID, so I spent nearly 45 minutes just registering (also the proctor talked to me really slow, so sometimes was difficult to hear her haha). The external camera also caused problems, because somtimes it disconnected and in the middle of the test the proctor took control of the mouse to reload the page and start recording again... I guess I overcomplicated my desk settings, so... I want to try again more prepapared for the registration and hopefully make it as smooth as possible.

1,"Hey everyone! found the many test day experiences on this subreddit to be incredibly helpful while I prepared for the GRE, so I would like to give back to the community by going through my experience and sharing some tips that I think were beneficial during my preparation. bit about myself and my prep: am from a engineering background, and hence I was inherently more comfortable with quant than I was with verbal. I knew that I only needed to review some topics in math and avoid making trivial errors during the test. was however quite intimidated by the verbal sections, especially because of the advanced vocabulary. So contrary to most of the advice on this subreddit, in an effort to surmount this fear, I spent a large portion of my time going through word lists (Powerscore Repeat Offenders, PrepScholar 357, misc.). By test day, I had reviewed around 1300 words. Of course, there were only a handful of these on the real test, but I believe this really helped my confidence in tackling the verbal section. Looking back, a lot of the time I utilized to memorize words and their definitions could have been devoted to doing something else, but I think the positive psycological impact it had for me was invaluable. from vocab, I did the ETS book in its entirety and I did all the text completion and sentence equivalence questions from the verbal ETS book. math, I only reviewed certain topics such as statistics, geometry and permutations/combinations, and did all the relevant questions from 5Lb. Manhattan Prep.  also purchased the Princeton Review GRE Premium Prep book which came with 4 online practice tests (bought it just for the practice tests).  test scores: =  Powerprep, MP = Manhattan Prep free mock, PR = Princeton Review  May - PP1 (V: 164/ Q: 170)  May - MP  (V: 163/ Q: 163) June - PR3  (V: 163/ Q: 167) June - PR6  (V: 163/ Q: 165) June - PP2  (V: 163/ Q: 166) June - PR7  (V: 158/ Q: 170) June - PR8  (V: 165/ Q: 170) about mock test scores: I wrote PP1 after about 10 days of memorizing words from Repeat Offenders (was done with \~ 450 words)
* Manhattan Prep free mock quant was extremely time consuming. I ran out of time with 3 questions left on the secon section, and this was much harder than the real test.
* Princeton Review tests were only average in quality, with PR7 and PR8 seeming especially subpar. PR7 had absurdly easy quant sections and PR8 had very straightforward verbal sections. However, they did grade your AWA essay, which was helpful to gauge where you stand in that aspect of the test. Test: testing procedure was extremely smooth and well organized. The center seemed to be following sanitazation protocols and everyone was sporting masks. We were only allowed to take our ID, pen (which they had provided), locker key and scratch paper into the testing hall. No water bottles were allowed. test itself started off with AWA topics I had seen before, which helped calm my nerves.  After AWA, I had QVQVQ (which was relieving as well). The first two quant sections were a breeze. Those quant questions were very straightforward and I had plenty of time left to check (and recheck) my answers. The topics were well distributed from algebra to statistics to geometry. The third quant section was definitely more difficult and involved than the first two. I made sure not to spend more than 2 mins on a question on the first go. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I realized that whenever I run out of time on a quant section during my mocks, it is usually because I get hung up on one particular question and this eats away at time I could be solving others. There was one question which I decided to skip for later, which I believe helped me look at it with a different perspective and hence get the answer. I finished the third section with about 3 mins left to check my answers. first verbal section was also fairly straightforward. This was at the level of the first section of PP1, and didn't really have many tricky questions. The second verbal section however was a completely different story. There were many questions which I could not confidently pick between two potential answers, and the RCs were more convoluted than the first section. I spent a lot of time on the second section RCs, and I had no time to check my answers in this section.  would not have been surprised to see a verbal score in the low 160s, but I suppose a lot of those 50-50s went my way :) thing to realize is that although many people see a dip in their actual GRE scores when compared to their mocks, mine was exactly the opposite: my highest score was on the actual test. So don't be too demoralized by the mock tests if you don't perform as well as you aspire to. Instead, attempt them with sincerity, and carefully analyze your results. Also, you really should attempt AWA while you write these mocks as well. There is a big difference between starting your test with a clear mind and starting after thinking and writing for an hour.  be happy to answer any questions related to the testing procedure or my preparation.

All the hype that you see here and other places, damn does he live up to it! The guy's a genius. I am an electronics engineering graduate and so quant was easier to me. The main issue I faced was with verbal as English is not my first language. I trusted Greg completely for Verbal and followed his one month plan (Though I took close to 2 months hehe) . All the videos are top notch and the exercises in the HW are complementary to the lectures. As I already mentioned, quant lectures were superfluous for me and I used them only when I needed to brush up some concepts or if  I found myself lacking in my mocks in any particular concept.  gave 5 mocks PP1-2 and PPP1-3. My scores ranged from 322-329 but I knew I was underperforming when I checked the answers and realized my mistakes. It is VERY important to analyze mistakes you make on the ETS mocks. I made a mistake of solving the paper based test before PP and hence my PP scores were not credible. I found myself not being able to complete questions in verbal in 30 minutes, so I adopted the strategy of solving the 10 TC/SE questions maximum in 12 minutes and then devote time to RC. Again Greg's TC/SE toolkit came in very very handy.  did not fret much over the AWA and just went through Greg's two videos on argument and Issue essay for structure. I am yet to receive my AWA scores, will update as I get them.  For Verbal lectures: GregMat+, for questions : Only ETS OG, VR and Big book. I went through 20 lists out of 28 by Greg and also Prepscholar 357.  did not take many quant lectures and focussed on solving as many questions as possible mainly from ETS material OG, QR and I also solved Manhattan 5lb.(Not all though)  have a drive link of all materials I used, I can DM you if you need it.

I studied?** I followed Greg Mat's 2-month plan, and believe me that's all you need to do. Manhattan 5lb (Tip: try to redo your questions on the test day, because you'll surely find 2-3  
mistakes that you have done. I was able to correct 3 questions). Greg's 840 words and Magoosh flashcards (common, basic, and advanced). for GRE at home?** an internet backup
2. just for safety, keep 1 mobile phone with you and have enough data in it, in case the wifi does not work.
3. Your back should face the entry door of your room, my proctor specifically asked me to align my camera such that the door is visible.
4. for mac users: this is an additional step
5. On your system setup your microphone volume to high.
6. Download the ProctorU app. Faced before the test?** I was unable to make the payment for the test registration (tried every possible thing), at last, I had contacted the helpdesk, they made the payment for me, they asked for my card number, CVV and expiry date. You can call them from 9-5 pm on Mon-Thursday.
2. System checks failing: I had issues with RAM and CPU system checks, I tried firefox as well, it didn't work for me. So I restarted my computer and reinstalled chrome and the proctorU app, and it worked :D  was my experience on exam day?** I clicked on the ""Start Test"" as soon as the timer went off, the proctor was able to connect with me in few seconds.
2. He did some settings on my computer (disable notifications, notify if any screen is attached, and disable screenshots).
3. He asked me to show him all the 4 walls, the desk and the screen with a mobile phone or mirror.
4. The test went smoothly, then I had my 10min break, where I would recommend that you should inform your proctor before leaving the room and also mention it in the chatbox, that you have your 10min break and you are leaving the room.
5. My proctor got changed while I was on the break. When I returned she asked me to show all the 4 walls, etc.
6. When the paper was finished, she asked me to show the whiteboard, and THAT'S IT :D. the very best (Y). to this community for helping me out. &lt;3","GRE at Home India 324( V:154, Q:170)",1624604813,10,538,1

This initially came as a huge relief to me who had given the PP2 over the weekend and ended up with only 328 (159V, 169Q). I'd previously given the PP1 a month back with a little vocab practice and got a 334(170Q, 164V) in it so I was terribly disheartened by the verbal in PP2, and after giving the paid test I'm just confused if the PP1 and PPP3 were just too easy compared to the real test or was the PP2 just too tough? I don't think I made any great changes to my approach in handling the verbal section, the PP2 just felt insanely hard. I've seen mixed experiences while going through posts so I'm not sure how to interpret these scores. What should I be doing over these next 3 days based on these? I've already gone through 5lb, ets material, kaplan, and for vocab I've done magoosh, barron's and manhattan's list apart from noting down a ton of words i encountered while practicing and giving tests. the quant in PP3 felt significantly more time consuming than PP1 or PP2 (though all my mistakes in PP3 were silly and due to lack of checking the answers again). Is the actual test more in alignment with that? I'm fairly consistent in quants and usually end up with 169 or 170 in all the free practice tests I've given (CS background helps) so i had stopped practicing quants this week because of my relative confidence but now I'm not so sure.  have high expectations for my score (a 333 is apparently the average gre score of accepted students at my first preference of college) so the anxiety of possibly scoring lesser is really getting to me.

1,"  This post is not to brag about anything or belittle any other score. It’s purely for the purpose of giving back to the community, evident from my verbal story. Perseverance is key.  
Hi everyone!  
Gave the GRE today and scored well! Extremely happy about it!!  
It was QVQVQ, which was preferable to me as I’m from an engineering background.  
Some background:  
**Vocab:** Did Greg’s 870 and Magoosh Common and Basic flashcards. I used to write all words that I came across and didn’t know. Did about 1500 words in total. I’m a non-native speaker but am well-versed with English as I live in a cosmopolitan city.  
**Quant:** I was always good with quant. Started my prep with Manhattan 5lb and got 85%+ correct in almost all chapters. However, I also did Greg’s Difficult Quant Problems series(5 videos till date), Quant Help Us Out series (3 videos till date) and ALL of the Problems Of The Day(including Quant concept mini quiz, quant POTD and Quant Extreme POTD).  
**Verbal:** Always struggled with verbal, right from the start. I was stuck on RC for a very, very long time. Did RC for 1.5 months probably and I’m not proud of it tbh. I then started reading The Hindu editorial section every day for 30 days and that helped me get familiar with tougher vocab and complex sentences. After giving PPP3 I realized that something else needs to be done so I start Greg’s Verbal practice session ([Verbal Practice - GregMat]( I cannot begin to explain how much this series helped me. It was probably the sole factor in my score going up from 153ish to 162. Just do this series RELIGIOUSLY and DILIGENTLY. Greg’s word is the word of Zeus. He’s the man, the myth and the legend. Each and every time I did RC, I used to feel despondent as my score never improved. Then I started to use his strategies to the T and saw massive improvements in both RC and TC. For SE, Pairing Strategy is ubiquitous.  
My experience:  
*Quant section 1:* Comparable to the free Powerprep questions in difficulty. Only 1 question when I had to double-check  
*Quant section 2*: A bit tougher than section 1 but manageable. Stumbled a bit on 2 questions but eventually got back to them and probably got them correct.  
*Quant section 3:* Comparable to section 2, a bit tougher though. Stumbled on 3-4 questions but could manage them towards the end.  
Quant takeaways: Time management is key. I skipped 1 question in section 1 of quant, 3 questions in Section 2 of quant and 4 questions in section 3 of quant. Had time left towards the end so got back to them in the end and probably got them correct. If you don’t understand a question in the maximum 2 readings, I’d suggest just skip it and come back later. Many a times, the perspective changes and you can get the answer in the 2nd try! section 1:* Same level as any of the Powerprep tests (Free or paid). Nothing out of the ordinary. Got one long RC with 4 questions in which I took 10 mins but covered up in the short ones.  
*Verbal section 2*: Similar level to section 1 but a bit tougher. Guessing that it was the Hard section. No long passages but one passage with 3 questions which was a lil tough. SE in this section was pretty tough tbh and TC was easier than Section 1(yes, easier than the medium section!). One TC 1-blanker question was directly and wholly taken from the PPP3! I was shocked when I saw this and read the sentence thrice just to “triple-check” 📷  
For verbal, I’d say use Greg’s strategies very diligently and you’ll be pretty much done. The most important ones were(in order): Guess Answer Before Looking At Choices, Process of Elimination, Justify Answer, Identify Main Idea and Sentence Function. I’m very happy and am extremely grateful to Greg! You’re the man!!  
I have asked the community a lot of questions(and answered a lot as well 📷 ), so please don’t refrain from asking for help!! AMA! is the man.  thanks to  [Scott\_TargetTestPrep](  and  [Vince\_Kotchian]( as well!

When I arrived at the test center, I showed the test proctor my ID and signed a sheet regarding testing policies and COVID health policy.

I was seated at one of the cubicles, and there were a few other people in the same room with me as well. I found the essays pretty easy and and used exactly 30 minutes for each essay. I was a little bit out of time for revising the last paragraphs of my essays, but I figured there shouldn’t be much errors.  I had VQVQV, which sucked for me because verbal wasn’t my strongest. There were many words I did not know on the exam and guessed a lot on RC questions.

If you're advanced, skip Interact. Waste of time. Get the 5 lb. book instead, refresh your fundamentals quickly and get straight to the questions. Don't waste hours watching funny training videos because time is finite and fatigue is real. While your attention is there, spend one weekend max refreshing your fundamentals and the rest of the time on questions. Read what strategy was used. You may not get them at first but the goal is to understand the strategies and rules so that you can then apply them later.  
 story:  
Took a practice test without studying and got a score in the high 150s-low 160s. Thought I could shoot for a perfect score with actual studying. I was busy at work, wasn't sure I would have time to study. Didn't want to take any chances so I paid for an on-demand program (Manhattan Prep Interact for GRE). Kind of ironic since what I chose ended up costing me more time, but now that my money was on the table, I had to go through the motions to get some worth out of it. has somewhere around 80-90 sections on various topics like evens &amp; odds, geometry, rates etc. I liked how they were grouped so it was easy to go straight to an area where you needed more support. Each section contained about 20 minutes of videos + 10 mins for their little quizzes with no ability to speed up the videos and if you leave the tab to listen in the background, it would pause so you had to spend the full time watching the presenters explain concepts in excruciating detail with funny little quips that while making the training more enjoyable, didn't add any instructional value. So 90\*30 = 2700 minutes = 45 hours = 9 weeks if you study 5 hrs/week on videos ONLY and you haven't even begun to knock out the real questions! I felt like I had to watch everything so that I wouldn't miss the advanced stuff but turns out that on the GRE, the bulk of the questions are basic with a twist, not advanced topics at all like curves or whatever. it's their trick to get you to buy more months when they waste your time. Don't know, but I see that it could be helpful for slow learners who are visual and REALLY need the hand holding or as a supplement to fast-paced learning elsewhere if you've got the extra bucks. verbal videos were counterproductive. One advice was to skip RC questions with ""except..."", like you're not still going to have to do them. They made up strategies out of thin air when really common sense and tuning to how the GRE asks questions are what is required. Worth looking into GregMat if you want a high score. ended up with V165 Q164 after one full month of studying from high 150s-low 160s with no studying at all. Not really the boost I was hoping for but it'll do for the programs I'm applying to.

It hurts even more that I got my argument essay common and still couldn't score above 4.5 in the AWA. Apart from that I am really satisfied with the scores (specially the quant).

1,"**Sharing my experience taking the GRE.** native English speaker engineering graduate working full time, studying for the GRE during weekday nights and weekends spent 1 month preparing for the GRE practice tests ranged between 320 - 328 kinda relieved with the score that I obtained as it was at least average. Personally felt that I could have gotten a higher score if I booked a later timing for the exam but lazy me did not want to spend more than 1 month on the GRE, hence the early booking and no retakes. for Quant:** Did 90% of my quant practice using Manhattan prep books, would say that the questions by MP are good as they are harder than the actual GRE quant questions Averaged 163 on my practice tests for Manhattan prep For my GRE, there was 3 quant sections, with 1 noticeably harder than the average standard. When you notice a quant section with much harder difficulty (and you are SURE of it being a experimental section), I would advise you to spend this time to ""relax and rest"" your brain and do some questions while preparing for the next section. For my case, when I saw the experimental question (difficulty = insane), mentally I went into power-saving mode and did not spend much energy on it, definitely helps your energy expenditure (GRE exam is crazy long and energy intensive) I would say most GRE questions only need max 5 steps. As soon as you are unable to solve a question after you exceed 5 steps, most likely you are ""brute-forcing"" / trial-and-error / on the wrong track to solve the question. Always keep in mind that most (90%) questions can be solved under 1.5min -&gt; and for questions that u know requires long workings / thinking, mark it and skip it first. Time management is key. For the data analysis part, always read the main story twice. If you got the main story / initial interpretation of the data wrong, it might cause u more than 1 mistakes. For the easy questions that u manage to complete under 20secs, always do it a second time on the spot to prevent silly mistakes (total time expenditure &lt; 1min) for comparison questions, ALWAYS these cases.  less than -1, -1, -1 to 0, 0, 0 to 1, 1, more than 1) -&gt; draw out a table to test out these cases, as long as you can show inconsistency in any two cases, be confident to mark out D as the answer for Verbal:** not able to give many tips for verbal since i got such a low score vocab is important (i only memorized around 100 vocab words when going into the exam - bad move haha) this video is pretty good ([ for vocab, retention for these words are good because of his explanations in terms of RC, do read more to improve reading speed (key to save time and improve comprehension) for AWA:** gregmat formats are good for exams (although I did not stick to those structure in the actual exam - mind decided to try something else) for argument essay -&gt; writing is fairly methodical -&gt; try to aim for 1 intro 4 para 1 closing argument essay: every line can be attacked! if there is survey, attack survey. if there are figures, attack figures. if there is comparison, attack the comparison. Have the mindset that everything the author say is wrong, and try to find a reason why. if english is not your native language, memorize standard phrases to reduce thinking time and effort (e.g. The author is making a bold assumption by stating bla bla bla)  for issue essay -&gt; can be methodical too -&gt; be it whether you take an agree/disagree stand, try to think of 3x ""for"" argument and 1x ""against"" argument personally used the structure of: intro - for - for - strong against - strong for (targeting the against) - conclusion spend the first 3 minutes to plan your essay before writing spend last 3 minutes to check and proof-read practice typing before your GRE to improve typing speed recommend practicing at least 5x of each essay type before taking exam -&gt; improve memory retention of examples u will use, angles to attack (argument), structure of essay, phrasing and coping with time pressure   personally for my essay practice, i only did essay outlines -&gt; do this if you are confident of your phrasings / writing, because doing outlines exposes you to more questions and lets u brainstorm more ideas in advance. BUT if you are not confident of writing / non-native english writer, writing out full essays to familiarize yourself with phrasing is more recommended. tips:** dont study on the day itself, keep the mind calm and rested, 4h is no joke try to book early timings so that your mind will not have a chance to be preoccupied with other things in between the day whenever you have the opportunity (during the exam), do NOT submit your section early but rather, say you have 5mins left for your section, use the remaining time to write notes / formulas / A B C D E on your other question papers to reduce writing time for your next sections practice thinking and typing at the same time (improves writing speed) for working adults, book exam on monday so you have sat and sun for your final sprint of revision schedule:** 3 weeks: average 2h/day week: avg 3h/day 3 weeks: average 6h/day week: average 6h/day youtube channels (that helped me alot during my preparation):**

Quant was more important than verbal to me, so the good verbal score was just an added bonus. I purchased Magoosh (by the time I learned about Greg it was too late lol). I liked its quant a lot, and I do believe it can be helpful to someone who can't stop struggling with the quant. However, you have to weigh up the pros and cons - **if the cost feels even slightly on the higher side for you, it's definitely not worth it** \- just go with Gregmat. I loved his quant as well. For me, it kinda was costly and given the option now, I'd just go with Gregmat and follow the one-month or the two-month plan depending on the timeframe.  anyone looking to improve verbal score, I'd definitely recommend the 15 verbal days of Greg's one month plan** or even the two-month plan if you have time. Seriously, it doesn't get better than Greg's strategies. website is a goldmine**. Seriously guys, if anyone of you prepping hasn't, please check it out. It's just $5, and possibly the best $5 you'll ever spend. I followed his one-month plan and it was immensely helpful. Greg's verbal strategies boosted my verbal score by atleast 5 points I think, although I can't give an exact estimate since this was my first attempt. The skills I learned watching his RC videos are ones I'll carry with me for a long time. I should also mention the daily 6 problem of the day videos, I really enjoyed them. Thank you u/gregmat, I owe a lot of my score to you. As an added bonus, you also made the prep fun and taught so many amazing skills that are useful outside the GRE as well. I hope you go a long, long way with your website. I'm recommending it to everyone in my friends and family (and redditors lol) who's taking the GRE.  took 7 mocks throughout my prep - 4 third party ones (just to get used to the fatigue part. They're not the best measure of your potential score by any means) and 3 ETS ones - two powerpreps and the PPP+3. My scores in those 3: 170Q, 157V 168Q, 153V 164Q, 160V **I scored a 318 in my very first diagnostic test** \- 164Q, 154V (Magoosh)) should mention, **I scored higher than all mocks in the test**. My highest mock score was in the PP1.  was kinda shocked at the sudden quant drop in PP2, but it was because I got stuck on the data questions for far too long - which is a rookie mistake. Seriously guys, **skipping questions and coming back is probably the best quant strategy** in my opinion**.** Just another one of many of Greg's gold strategies. While practicing a quant section, it has happened to me so often that I'd come across a question I can't solve or one that takes me over 2 minutes (and I feel I haven't made enough progress in the last 45 seconds or so), so I'd skip it and come back and boom, things just click while trying it again. Someone on this sub mentioned the brain subconsciously keeps working on the problems we skip. Not sure how accurate that is but I definitely felt it multiple times. For people aiming at higher or perfect quant score, I'd definitely recommend the advanced quant section in manhattan 5lb book less than a week before the exam (it got the ""thinking juices"" flowing for me lol). Also **GMAT club hard questions**, as they're based on the same concepts, they're harder, and they're from ETS.  vocab, I did 2 lists - **Greg's 840 list and Magoosh (basic and common words only)**. I think I knew over 80-85% of the words in the test today, make of that what you will. **For AWA- Greg mat's template is gold**, and it helped me so much in writing good essays today. also maintained an error log but forgot to review it before the test lol importantly,** **have faith in yourself.** Seriously. Take my example - I scored higher than all mocks in the actual test. Instead of assuming the worst before the test, try to assume the best instead. Instead of telling myself something like ""please can I just get something at least close to 320"" before the exam, I told myself ""what if I end up with a 330+?"". I never believed it was possible to be honest, but imagining it still felt nice lol. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes at the end of the test. Test anxiety stems from the fear of uncertainty that we all have, but seriously if you do have it just try to think of the test as yet another mock, that really helped me. I also planned a date for my 2nd attempt before the test - it kinda helped calm me down and believe nothing's at stake.  apologize if the haphazard manner in which I wrote this was annoying lol. Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck! You got this. Have faith :)","Unofficial 168Q, 162V first attempt at home. The relief is real. Thank you Greg Mat!",1621181961,19,1291,1

1,"I wrote my exam on May 2nd (centre) &amp; got my official scores today! Finally!  scores: 329/340 [V - 162, Q - 167] 
AWA: 5.0 8, 2021:  (Paper Based Test 1) : 313/340 [I did the ETS Math Review and solved the initial chapters from Manhattan 5LB mostly because getting an abysmal diagnostic would have kept me from ever starting; no verbal prep except some Vocab from Magoosh]  only wrote mock exams a week before my exam (last week of April):  324/340 Based Test 2: 325/340 328/340 (May 1st, 2021)  333/340 to Greg (the tutor):  huge shoutout to Greg, ofcourse. My verbal's on the lower end and I expected to do much better but with work &amp; covid, I couldn't really find the time or motivation to practice all of his strategies. I did a bulk of the vocab towards the very end. His strategies are gold even if I couldn't get the most out of it. Plus, I really enjoyed his classes so I take much more away from his subscription than just my score. :)  all the engineering grads who can't understand why their quant is on the lower end: you SHOULD watch Greg's quant videos. The impulse to /always solve/ will not serve you everytime and I realised this early on, which is why I did the quant videos from his one month plan. Don't get me wrong, I did properly solve most questions on the GRE just because that's my instinct but when it doesn't work 1 minute in, or you're not confident on some concept, you should have a secondary tool to crack the problem open. Play to your strengths, but have a toolkit when you need a Plan B.   it so you have a 'toolkit' with you, like Greg says.  answer if the exam has gotten harder:  was my first attempt so I don't know what it used to be. I can only compare with the ETS material, and for quant: yes, it is 'harder' but not significantly so. There's no need to worry! A question I wondered, almost annoyingly, is - HOW has it gotten harder? Is it the complexity of the concepts, is it more tedious in terms of calculations, do you just run out of time? The answer is: the ETS official questions only test one concept at a time most times. The real exam will test two in quite a few. They were also a bit more wordy, the traps can sneak up on you sometimes.   again, nothing has changed significantly.   thing I noticed on my practice tests was that I had 10-13 mins to review on my first quant section and 5-7 mins on my second quant section (HARD). So, when the difficulty increased by a slight amount, I was able to accomodate that during my real exam without a significant loss to my score.   Thank you, Gregmat! I was a mess before my exam because of various reasons (As luck would have it, I even got sick on the day of - NOT covid), but I had pushed too many things till the very end. I freaked out when I watched Greg's structure videos and tried writing practice essays because I could only manage 350 words at the max. I had no time to spend on AWA because I still had prep to do on the Reasoning Sections. So, I sent* my essays to him and he quickly read them and told me that the writing was good enough for a 5/6 but the word count needed to be increased. Honestly I have no idea why he said the writing was good. I considered it to be quite crap, but this boosted my confidence. I focused on my word count and even my writing got better simply due to his words of encouragement. After that point, I wrote an AWA section with my practice tests and that's all the prep I did for it. I got the Claim - Reason prompt for which I just followed the Issue Essay organisation and addressed both Claim and Reason + Additional Reason based off off an old Reddit comment Greg had made.  studied for a total of 1.5 months &amp; my prep did not go as planned at all. I planned to do much more than I did but all in all I'm happy. I would advice people to be organised (use Notion) from the very beginning, as sort of a regret I felt towards the end.  an underrated aspect of Greg's subscription is his philosophy. I remember in his videos how he looked at a problem that he might have gotten wrong with respect for ets, rather than berating himself for being stupid. That shit's healthy and I'm glad I inculcated that in whatever way I did (I have a lot of mental health issues and my relationship with exams has been toxic for years. I NEEDED this).  I didn't sleep the night after my exam because I was paranoid I'd read my score wrong; was it 167 or 161? Fun stuff.   shoutout to Greg (the person):  few days before my exam, my Mom got sick (came out negative tho). After my exam, my brother got sick AND tested positive. I'd subscribed to Gregmat on April 6th but had forgotten to cancel it due to the stress of all this. I only realised it when the email for a recurring charge came. I emailed him and he was kind enough (I teared up a bit honestly) to refund it. To be clear, I fully understand that I should have been more mindful but thank you, Greg, for the kindness you showed me during a crazy week. You're gold!  this was a very unstructured rant, but I'd be happy to answer specific questions in the comments.

1,"***Want to clarify that these are very brief suggestions for people who are getting 315-25 without any preparation and want to score in the high 30s, particularly people who have very high qualifications in math and literature but still can't seem to get those top 5% scores*** started with a baseline score of 322 in PP1 with zero idea about the test which went up to 327-329 after 10 days of studying. After that, I stopped studying because the amount of work needed to go higher didn't seem worth it. Eight days before the test which was today, I began noticing some very silly mistakes that were keeping me from making full use of the knowledge I had. Just want to lay them out for people like 4.0 mechanical engineering majors that are wondering why they can't seem to crack 165+ in GRE quant. Really focus on number properties, particularly for the QC questions. Negative numbers, positive numbers, zero, one, numbers between 0 and 1, and numbers between -1 and 0 should all be checked for equivalence separately unless the question specifically omits one of those intervals.
2. GRE questions never feature long calculations. If you've got over 5 lines written on your scratch paper for a problem, you're either doing it wrong or you're missing an observation that'll get it solved much faster. This was really hard for me to get used to since I was coming off doing pages after pages of calculation for my undergraduate courses. So this is for all the engineering and physical sciences majors out there, ***don't go all rain man in there.***
3. A quick skim over the quant syllabus can be helpful, doesn't matter what resource you use. I started studying Manhattan Test Prep books but later switched to the Magoosh videos because I could play them at 2xspeed and fast forward through most of it. I didn't need to learn the topics, I just needed to know what topics were in there. Knowing exactly what tools you're supposed to use makes it less likely to take approaches that are not optimal. Don't start reading the answer options before you've got an answer in your head already. I know this is the most frequently repeated advice by every tutor but trust me, it's worth hearing every time. Most of my early struggles in verbal came from reading the answers too early and getting convinced by their enticing vocabulary and framing. Once you stop falling into that trap, only then can you spot your other weaknesses and improve upon them.
2. I didn't read a single vocabulary list. And I don't see the point of doing that for anyone other than the most novice English speakers. Unless you're used to a word being employed in various scenarios through regular utilization, you are almost certainly going to miss the meaning ETS was going for in a tension packed exam scenario. Most unfamiliar words can be demystified through contextualization on the spot. I think all four of my mistakes in the verbal section were due to not knowing the meaning of certain words and I've yet to find myself ineligible for anything except the most uber competitive literature programs. But if you're aiming for those, you should know a lot more unusual words than me anyway. sure if I should give advice without getting my score first, but I'll be shocked if it's anything under 5. My epiphany came when I realized that the GRE essay was less of an academic endeavor and more of a passionate debate with a friend, or on reddit. The prompts and the scoring criteria seem to emphasize social and reasoning skills a lot more than writing skills. People who like writing long paragraphs on reddit about politics or economics were pretty much born for this. If there is one technical advice I could offer, it'd be to skim through the issue prompts on the ETS website and make your mind up on the more controversial ones. Some of these issues have been topics of debate among nobel laureates for hundreds of years, it'll probably take you 15-20 minutes to even decide what your stance on the issue is if you see it on the test for the first time. isn't the gold standard of tests, but it does favor proactive thinking above all other academic abilities. There is no one perfect system, or one guy with a perfect formula. You're gonna have to go through the content with an active eye on what's working for you and why, and what isn't.

Experience:** started off strong feeling comfortable with both of my essay prompts and able to close those out with confidence to score a 4.0 at the least. Toward the end of my argument essay, I felt an urge to pee. I finished up and got my proctor's attention when she realized my microphone had stopped working. Thankfully this happened in-between sections because we had to resolve this before moving forward. I took the time to close my eyes and breathe to prepare for the next section of the test. In the end I did not get a chance to pee until the break but I was able to remain focused through the sections. had VQVQV, and thought my first verbal section was pretty tricky compared to the subsequent two. I had a reading passage that had two long paragraphs which didn't quite resemble a long or a short passage so it threw me off a bit. The math was fine. I saw a lot of posts on here saying that the quant has become materially harder than some of the published ETS material. It was definitely more difficult than the Big Book but overall resembles the stuff you see in the paper test and practice booklets. TTP got me used to a barrage of medium/hard difficulty questions under time constraints so I finished both math sections with a minute and some seconds to spare.

My scores didn't improve much from the couple months of studying but what did really improve was how comfortable I was come test day. And hey, 321 is my highest combined score! My quant score didn't really change from my practice, but I'm completely fine with that. I was able to keep calm on test day and be smart about where I spent my time.  didn't find the quant section to be any harder than practice, but I was sad to see that some of the questions I knew I struggled with were tested. I think February was when I actually studied vocab using Vince's app and [vocabulary.com]( and when I watched a bunch of gregmat videos which explains that verbal increase. I struggled with motivation to study because of my full-time job and taking another class, but I did manage to study for at least 1 full day a week in March.

My biggest struggle for any essay I've ever written is starting. When I first practiced the GRE topics I had a solid 10 minutes of panic with nothing to show for it. I think I read someone's comment on this subreddit to just set a 5min timer and brainstorm for a random essay topic for practice and that was AMAZING ADVICE. I can flesh out examples pretty well but coming up with them was just pathetic. The week before the test, I kept doing those 5 min of brainstorming. I went from trying to at least get a stance and 2 main ideas, to being able to get an intro, 2 main ideas, and 2 examples. I wrote a couple essays untimed (found they took about 45 min to finish). On test day, somehow I pumped out those essays. For the argument essay I had EXTRA time; I was able to edit and add another example!

But, knowing how I study for challenging things, I budgeted 4 months (including the holiday period, so not 4 solid months) to prep for the GRE. I really did not want to retake it, so I front-loaded my studying. I wanted to share my regiment and materials used, in case helpful for anyone else. This sub was immensely helpful and saved me from numerous pitfalls. **Total 331 - V:167 Q:164 AWA:6.0**
* My unofficial was the same as my official. I was really nervous they’d be different, luckily no change Process** My prep was *all over the place*. Initially, before experience taught me better, I had planned to exclusively use Magoosh 3-month for prep, and the two free PowerPrep tests for final benchmarking. Hoo boy was I mistaken...
* This sub's emphasis on maximizing ETS materials and deemphasizing some aspects of other materials (Manhattan Verbal, Magoosh Quant, etc.) showed me the light
* Absolutely essential in my (relatively) successful GRE results were /u/Scott_TargetTestPrep's math equation guide, and /u/gregmat's vocab, quant review, and AWA guide videos
* Ultimately I ended up finishing \~40% of the Magoosh curriculum, completed the whole official Quant guide, completed the entire official GRE guide, 8 chapters of Manhattan Prep Quant on weak subjects, 13 ""Big Book"" tests (only quant questions &lt;= 60% solved), and a ton of greg mat videos
* In case helpful, here is the chronological progression of my mock test scores:
   * Magoosh Mock: V162 Q154
   * ETS Paper 1: V164 Q164
   * ETS Paper 2: V169 Q164
   * ETS PP1: V169 Q166
   * ETS PP2: V162 Q162
   * Official: V167 Q164 Test Experience** My sections were QVQVQ, and either of the first two Qs felt like they could have been the experimental
* **Verbal summary**: Hardest parts were the long-form and short-form passages. They were quite technical, and on topics that kind of bore me (art history), so following the meandering prose was really difficult. Lots of ""select all that apply"" style questions, which are time vampires. I did not find the vocab or sentence equivalence questions very difficult
* **Quant summary**: Holy shit you guys. The quant stuff blew me away. What I think was the experimental section was nearly impossible (I've been a mid-160s scorer for months now in practice tests...) and required me to rapid fire select random answers for at least 3 questions because time ran out. For the other sections, I was mostly struck by how involved all of the questions were. I got *zero* straightforward geometric diagram questions, which are my bread and butter. I think I was so-so on my answers for 75%+ of the questions...just tried my best. Upon review of the diagnostic, the questions did skew a little hard (though not all 5's like they felt at the time), and I did guess correctly a few times, so the scaling was in my favor. I nearly broke down crying at the end of the test when I saw my score. It just felt that unlikely at the time...
   * Weird thing - I felt that my first real Q section was massively hard and the second was a bit easier, but neither my score (164) or the difficulty ratings of the questions indicate that was the case. Still weird...
* **AWA summary**: I got 5s on all of my ScoreItNow submissions, and felt that it consistently dinged me for bogus and often incorrect reasons. So I felt confident that a human may in fact see fit to award me with a 6 for an essay or two. Luckily that ended up happening, and earning a flat 6 on the AWA was thrilling. I mainly credit /u/gregmat's strategy videos here; I just followed his recipe and stayed true to writing in my voice using my vernacular. It worked!

I watched the gregmat videos, so I'm not sure what I could do to improve the score? I don't know if it would be worth repeating the GRE for the sake of a point? have a strong GPA, industry experience, will have completed my masters and have been involved in relevant extra-curriculars, so I'm wondering if people have any advice on whether these scores will lock me out?

I'm planning to take the GRE online and my earliest MBA deadline is the 23rd of March, so I am planning to take it on the 13th so that I can focus on doing the application (I also have other things to do like work and other engagements lol) Any advice as to what I should do in the next 10 days? I'm going through the vocab list and feel pretty confident about the level I am at (of course I don't know ALL the words lol). So far I've been doing rather poorly on reading comprehension, especially inference questions. That said, I am a fast reader and always have about 10-15 minutes left when I'm finished with my verbal. Maybe I should just spend time to reread questions etc? I do make silly mistakes.
2. Would it better to just take the test later and give myself a bit more time? But even then, I only have maybe a week or so I can give, and I don't know how much difference 7 days will make, whereas I feel that it'll be easier to focus on writing the essays and filling out the application once Im done with the GRE. I dont have any plans to retake it.
3. Advice on how to improve on quants? I feel like I'm not pacing myself well enough and just keep getting frustrated, slowing down my efficiency. I run out of time, and usually end up having to guess maybe 2-3 questions.
4. Lastly, any more free resources? I am trying to not spend any money right now for studying for the GRE, so I'm only using the free practice tests that are available.

1,"After a lot of vacillation regarding the dates, I finally took this beast of an exam on 15th Feb. I'm a non-native (Indian) speaker of English sharing my experiences of preparation and exam date. began preparing for GRE last year (August). It might seem a long time since then till the exam date but I was not particularly focused on preparation during the initial months as I have a full-time job on the side as well. I focused on brushing up my quant skills and gaining vocab knowledge in the first few months. I'm particularly lacking in memorization skills, so it took me a far longer time to learn an adequate number of words. A fast learner can speed up this part more effectively. I shall outline what books, resources, and strategy I used for prep: Manhattan 5lb book problems. I solved all the problems from each chapter in sets of 20. I would give the first set (first 20 problems of a topic chapter) untimed to just test the waters and analyze whether I'm adept at all the concepts required. Thereafter, I attempted all the rest of the problems in a timed set of 20 problems, just like you would have in the exam (20 probs, 35min). For concepts, I would refer to Google or ETS Gre Math Conventions PDF.
2. 320 GRE Math Problems (Steve Warner): Only solve those if you have time to kill (like in my case I solved Manhattan way too early and in later weeks didn't have enough quant resources left). Vocabulary: I started my prep with the Magoosh Flash Cards app. My strategy initially was to learn one set a day and revise all the learned sets on weekend. However, I soon fell victim to my poor memorization skill and settled for learning 20-30 words per day with 2-3 days gaps in-between. I would revise the words in the meantime during the gap. Also, I had to drop preparation for a good 3-4 weeks due to work pressure. . As I said earlier, someone can speed-up this portion of preparation according to one's ability. I would in the end recommend two word-lists for vocab:
   1. Magoosh Flash Cards App
   2. Powerscore Repeat Offenders (available on Quizlet in sets of 20 by kappams). I had PDF copies of both sets containing all the words for quick reference and revision.
2. RC: **Don't do Manhattan RCs**. I made this mistake and it costed me in terms of prep time. The answers are distorted and very ambiguous and the logic Manhattan employs in one RC doesn't apply to another and everything seems contradictory. Good resources are:
   1. ETS Verbal (Official Guide, Official Verbal Reasoning)
   2. Princeton 1014 Book only RCs.
   3. Big Book problems. (I would suggest it is easier to practice from [greprepclub]( This website has a feature of error-log and timer for solving problems. 2nd &amp; 3rd resources here are useful for folks who felt only the official ETS sources are not sufficient for mastering RCs.
3. TC/SE: I observed it would come automatically as you mug up vocab well. For practice, ETS resources are best. I would not suggest Big Book cause vocab problems there are a bit obsolete as compared to now. And similarly, don't do **Manhattan TC/SE**. They use their proprietary word sets heavily in the problems and you most probably won't see those words in an ETS exam. Videos are the gold standard here. Watch his videos to learn paragraph structure and other essay writing strategies. ETS website has a list of issue and argument topics. I practiced a few of them and I believe one has ample practice while appearing on practice tests. Tests** Kaplan Practice Sets (Flash software): These are helpful to gauge progress in between preparation. Maybe one can give 1-Verbal,1-Quant set on weekends. I would advise not to waste these practice sets recklessly, and space them out throughout prep-duration.
* Mock Tests: An image would speak better than words: Test Scores]( For more practice, one can use [GRE-KMF Chinese site]( It has free PPP sets. I would advise don't waste them to solve PP-I and PP-II problems as they must be attempted in a test environment. Day Experience (Test Center)** was worried sick a few days before the exam as there has been a general consensus on Reddit and other forums (FB groups) that quant has gotten increasingly difficult with some folks claiming even Manhattan Tests can't compare to that of the actual exam. I mean no disrespect to them but I found Quant exam difficulty fairly manageable. I had sections in the order: QVQVQ. I believe the 1st Q section was an experimental one cause it seemed like Manhattan Test #5,#6 level. The 2nd and 3rd Q sections were comparatively easier than Manhattan. I did well on Verbal 1, hence I found the 2nd set fairly difficult, especially RCs. AWA Topics: Issue Task: Maintaining a Social Appeal has become more important in today's society, even if it requires bending the reality or truth \~ something like that
2. Argument Task: Health conditions have improved for City X. Survey results were given. 3 arguments were given:
   1. The survey compared eating habits with another decade-old survey.
   2. Increased intake of cholesterol regulating food.
   3. Reduced intake of a food product amongst citizens which is generally seen being avoided by healthy people. I have heard good reviews of GregMat's material, however personally I got to know about him quite late and didn't have time to peruse through his material other than AWA.

1,"**Issue Essay**  Even though young people often receive the advice to “follow your dreams,” more emphasis should be placed on picking worthy goals.  Many people’s dreams are inherently selfish. claim that the author makes describes the quintessential struggle that a young person goes through in their journey of finding their place in the world. The author says that because most dreams are selfish, it would be more responsible to shift the value system in place towards picking loftier goals. These goals would ideally be, according to the author, less selfish and be geared towards helping society at large. In my opinion, although the author has the right intentions, reductionism to this extent is disingenuous for something that is so meaningful and relates to how so many people live out their lives. I present three reasons to outline my argument. and foremost, let us begin with one absolute truth - all humans beings are unique. As a species, we are specially endowed to be so vastly different from each other that even children of the same parents can ultimately dream entirely different dreams and live entirely different lives. It is through these differences that genius is born. Although the surest progress that mankind makes is through incremental steps from the contributions of the countless anonymous souls that grace our planet - true milestones for us as a species have always been made by a few geniuses. From Albert Einstein to Isaac Newton, from Michael Jordan to Usain Bolt - these are all remarkable individuals who, if had not pursued their dreams, their genius would be lost to the sands of time. It is through their talent and hard work that they rose through the masses to claim their place in history. Hence, shifting the emphasis on people pursuing their dreams and telling them to do more quotidian work - is not the solution. even if such an emphasis was placed, it would guarantee one extremely undesirable outcome. Most people who were then not encouraged to pursue their dreams would live out their lives in disappointment. Knowing that they could have done much more would eat at their heart and pervade every sphere of their lives, leading to unhappiness and severe crises. The truth is that what is important for most people is not to be successful but to go all the way and give it their best shot. If it wasn't meant to happen - it won't and most people would be content with that. However, if they were to live out their existence without giving any weight to what their heart wants, it would make them miserable and prevent them from doing good work elsewhere as well. judging dreams is a tricky thing in itself. What if a person wants to become a successful actor or singer in order to provide for his parents? What if someone wants to become a civil servant in order to mint money through corrupt practices? Life ebbs and flows and changes course at all times. Trying to steer the outcome of someone's life based on their dreams is an unpredictable and valueless business. Setting up systems to spot talent and nurture creativity is how things should be done instead. Contrary to popular belief, life is not a pie of a fixed size where in order for someone to win, someone else should lose. Fostering both - societal and community values and lonesome genius - are worthy goals. conclusion, while we ideally wish for a community where everybody might be trailblazers, it simply isn't true that something like that will ever happen. It is the responsibility of society to latch onto these people whenever they come along in history so that we may too, rise with them to new heights of achievement. While helping society at large remains a worthy goal, some gems are too rare to be left in the ground. Polish them, make them shine brighter and their true value emerges. Essay** following appeared in a letter from the faculty committee to the president of Seatown University: study conducted at nearby Oceania University showed that faculty retention is higher when professors are offered free tuition at the university for their own college-aged children. Therefore, Seatown should institute a free-tuition policy for its professors for the purpose of enhancing morale among the faculty and luring new professors. author proposes a new system for the Seatown University in which they outline that given the success rate of faculty retention and hiring in Oceania University owning to their new free-tuition policy, the same should be adopted for Seatown, in order to capture more talent. Although at the face of it, the argument carries considerable weight, a thorough analysis of this proposal reveals various inadequacies and inconsistencies that must be verified before any such decision can be made. I present three arguments to further my case. and foremost, the basis for instituting such a policy is stated as since at Oceania it was observed to have improved the faculty hiring, it must apply to Seatown too. This is a setup for failure since the exact reasons for the improvement at Oceania University aren't verified to be singularly attributed to this new policy. Several other factors might be involved - Oceania might just be a better university in terms of its location, its funding, or even its diaspora. Only when an ablation study confirms that it was only because of this policy that change was effected, can this claim be taken to be absolutely accurate. it needs to be clear how such a policy would affect the institution financially. Because the policy would deny the college of the tuition fee of several students, the funds of the University would take a hit. If this hit proves to be detrimental to its very operation, then such a policy would definitely not warrant execution. Since the conditions of the policy might not be retractable, a thorough study of exactly how much brunt the funds of the University can bear would be required. Only when verified can a reasonable decision can be made. such a policy would inevitably attract a very specific subsample of professors from the very wide academic community. These would be the ones with children belonging to a very specific range of age. It is not necessary for the professors of the highest caliber in their respective fields to fall in this small category. Whereas the only true metric for the university to strive to hire on the basis of, should be that of caliber. Moreover, this would decrease the quality of academic discourse and educational facilitation as the community would not be as varied and diverse as could be. Diversity provides value by exposing thoughts and opinions to several different viewpoints and finding chinks in their armor wherever possible. The loss of such an important value would definitely reflect in the general atmosphere of instruction and might prove harmful to the university in terms of its quality. conclude, although the university requires fresh blood and even old blood to stay to strengthen itself, of the various approaches it could take to do so - this isn't the right one. It could easily backfire and prove to be a bane. A more thorough and severe analysis of the proposal is required that enumerates with precision what its effect would be. Only when armed with this information, should the final decision be made. are from one of the Manhattan test papers)",Please help me analyze my essays. Thank you so much!,1614191676,12,1358,1
1,"I just got my GRE score today after I took the at home version about two weeks ago. I’m quite satisfied with the score although I underperformed a bit on verbal due to test day nervousness and fatigue. I have some tips that I would like to share about my studying strategy for you guys. Quant (Manhattan 5lbs book (2nd), OG Quant, OG General) through the ETS GRE Math Review quickly to familiarize yourself with all the topics. Then, go through all sections of the 5lbs book and make sure to keep an error log on an Excel sheet with all the questions you got wrong (fyi I was averaging 80% accuracy on each section although I often made silly errors because sometimes I wasn’t a 100% focused). After you’re done with the 5lbs book, go through the OG Guides but time yourself to get used to the real testing condition. For Quant its very important to keep a detailed error log and to review the questions at the end of each week until you practically memorize them. Testing stamina and Mental resilience (Powerprep 1 and 2, Powerprep Plus 1,2, and 3)  is a long ass exam that is really taxing. Do not make the mistake of thinking you’ll do well just because you score well on individual sections that you do in isolation. You must practice tackling the whole exam in actual testing condition. Thankfully, the five Powerprep exams are perfect for training you for the real thing. I know the PP+ exams are ridiculously expensive, but they’re so worth it so please do purchase them for your own sake. About a month before the actual exam, each week, I simulated the real testing experience by taking the Powerprep exam at the exact time the real exam was scheduled and under strict testing conditions (be really anal about this. Don’t give yourself extra breaks or snacks and drinks during the sections that won’t be allowed in the real GRE). After the tests, you should of course go through the wrong answers and log them in the error log. I think the Powerprep tests were by far the most beneficial resource that I used and the test simulations that I did was certainly the most effective prep that helped me perform well on the actual GRE. A lot of people say that Quant is a lot easier on the Powerprep and thats generally true. But the Quant on PPP2&amp;amp;amp;3 are about equal if not more difficult. You can refer to my scores on the Powerprep exams to calibrate your expectations. V/Q/AWA 168/169 168/169 167/164/5 (I was very tired that day) 168/170/5 169/169/5 AWA (Gregmat videos + ETS Official pool of essay topics) watched three videos by Gregmat and that was more than enough for AWA. Watch the two videos titled Argument/issue essay step-by-step guide and copy down the template he used on a word document. Go to the ETS website that has all the essay topics and start practicing. Also, theres a video on Gregmat’s channel where he literally writes the essay in 15 minutes and it was really helpful because it made me realize that these essays do not need to be works of literary art. Whenever I tackle the AWA I start off with brainstorming three examples and then just churning out as much bullshit as possible. I think I average around 650-700 words of BS per essay. It becomes so mechanical that I don’t really need to concentrate that much and usually finish with about 10+ minutes remaining. On the test day I didn’t even bother editing the essay and just took the extra 10 minutes to rest after fixing some glaring spelling mistakes.

 apologize for the shitty formatting, but this is the best I can do on my phone atm :(  you’ll find some use out of my experience and if anything you’ll be reassured by the fact that someone whose writing is this shitty still managed to score a 5 on the AWA. If you have any questions feel free to ask.  Oh, and for verbal I didn’t really study other than memorizing like 2000 vocab words. I’m generally okay with reading comprehension because I used to like literature and stuff in high school.  of luck r/GRE fam!!",165V 170Q 5AWA - Tips for Quant and AWA,1614172802,9,813,1

1,"I took the GRE in November 2020 and ended up with a 166/164...which I was relatively happy with at the time.  planning to apply to MBA programs this fall, but I find myself feeling more and more anxious as my score clears the theoretical bar, but not by much...e.g., HBS’s most recently admitted class averaged a 163/163 (my quant is only one point above this median...). I feel like I have a decent foundation, but am worried I may be misremembering details (detrimentally so) or not focusing on the right “stuff” (e.g. rates and work), particularly when it comes to Quant. anyone have experience getting back on the horse and starting over, but not really starting over, when it comes to studying for the GRE? details: I originally started with Manhattan Prep, but gradually moved away from those materials and focused on Gregmat &amp; official GRE stuff the first go around.",Tips on Returning to the Study Grind?,1613677971,8,183,1
1,"This is going to be a little long. So bear with me for a while as I pour down all my frustration after  receiving an horrible marks. Far less than what I had expected or ever dreamt. My mock test scores:** My Power Prep I scores were 145V/163Q. Whereas Power Prep II score that I just took yesterday after 6 months of practice was 154V/161Q . (Although I already knew answer to some of the questions beforehand since I had already seen and practiced them somewhere in all this time.) Expectation Vs Reality:** So I was expecting around anywhere greater than 310 with all the effort that I had put in. Being a non native speaker, I had indulged a lot of my initial time in Vocab, either learning meaning of all those obscure words or differentiating between diffident and dissident for instance. Being from a computer engineering background, quant didn't seem to bother me but I did occasionally make some silly mistakes.  My preparations?** :  One can easily guess how much I would have covered in this time. I was not working anywhere and hence solely focused on GRE. I completed ETS verbal question book, quant question, Official guide to GRE. I did almost all quant from Manhattan 5 lb. book. I did few sets from old GRE. I learnt entire vocab list of GREGMAT and common , basic words from Maghoosh flash cards. I took 2 official ETS tests (powerpre I and II) and also the paid three from the Chinese website. I took 7 Kaplan mock test and two Manhattan mock tests. I watched every tips and trick videos available freely on GREGMAT's website and Vince Youtube channel. In short, I did every resource I found available. My limitations?** As mentioned, I really did have trouble with Vocab. For instance, my fluctuations in scores were so high that even at the last moment, I couldn't predict how much correct would I get. The range was just too high. For example, I would score 14 correct in one and dramatically just 7-8 in other. It was just so inconsistent.  I would follow all the u/gregmat strategies, thinking about blank first, RC three tips and tricks , SE matching pair but none would work. Like sometimes I would figure out what passage was trying to say but it would take me 10 minutes or more. Sometimes even that would turn out incorrect. I would pair synonyms but it seems some words just fit the context and aren't that matching as well. However, near the end with much practice I did manage to get few correct all the time and hoped for the same in the test.  Testing Experience?** I got Q/V/Q/V/Q having no idea which one was experimental. After writing two essays, my mind was already fatigued but I had prepared so much that I could carry on and knew it wouldn't be much of an issue. I believe I wrote decently without much effort. One thing I would like to  highlight is ,at least for me , quant was not difficult. It was in same levels with the mock tests. But I screwed up and that was solely mistake on my part. I took long time reviewing and answering easy initial questions and didn't have time for 4-5 questions in the end. So I learnt form it and speeded in next two quant and I had 5 minutes extra in both of them. But I think due to a disastrous first section, I got an easy section and that can be seen in my unofficial marks. Although I think I got most of them correct, it didn't contribute much to my score. That  seemed the case  for verbal as well, at least that is the only plausible explanation I can think of since I thought I pretty good in second section of verbal. I managed to comprehend all the passage and even have time for reviewing my answers. But the first section, I was just clueless. All my practice seem to go in vain. Time was ticking and I couldn't just find a possible fit for the blank. I thought of my word but it was way off than the options given. I couldn't even make a close guess. When I moved to passages, time was running out and I couldn't comprehend what it was trying to say. When I figured it out, the question were so confounding, and answers equally enigmatic. (Don't judge. At least I can find some place where these weird GRE vocab would actually be used.) What now?**  I don't know. I don't even have courage to take the test the second time. If I fail after all these months of deliberate practice, it isn't wrong to assume that I might screw on the next day as well. Also the test is so expensive and the owing to the amount of time I am invested, I am surely in dilemma. Although I would like to thank u/gregmat and all the others for making the process convenient and sharing pretty useful resources. I used to get really hopeful witnessing other people sharing their excellent results but unfortunately not to be in my case. I am highly demotivated right now but still what can we do?

Honestly, every experience that I've read about certainly helped in one way or another. the recent quant difficulty: I can confirm that this is kind of true. My quant portions were definitely trickier than the official PP and PPP, and this can be attributed to the fact that a greater amount of questions required you to find shortcuts to solving the problem. A lot of the harder questions involved statistics and geometry. Note that the questions don't actually require additional knowledge but require different approaches. The data interpretation is harder and requires more analysis that the official test. The verbal is about the same as the powerprep plus test.  been practicing vocabs since october last year (2002), but nothing intense. I took the free diagnostic test from kaplan in September and scored 155V 166Q. I skipped the AWA and paused once or twice during quant. only started seriously studying for the GREs at the beginning of this year.  practice scores from the official practice tests were (in chronological order):**
PP1: 160V 160Q
PPP1: 164V 163Q
PPP3: 159V 168Q
PP2: 160V 164Q
PPP2: 166V 167Q 161.8V 164.4Q my scores from magoosh were
162-166Q and 160-165V (Estimator)
Mock test 1: 164 V 165Q think what made my score jump up in the real exam was that I paced myself better in both the sections. The problem I had in quant was that I just couldn't move on from questions that I couldn't do (this usually bites me in the ass because then I don't have time for the later portions), but in the real exam, _I took my best guess and moved on_. think one tip for you all is that, at least for me, time management and accuracy were the things that differentiated a 160Q from a 165+Q.

1,"Back in 2017, after experiencing the horrible side of Big 4 Consulting (in terms of work life balance, meagre pay, pathetic management and crappy office politics), I planned to get an MBA. Main aim of getting an MBA is to get international exposure and get out of a rut which was nowhere in sight in my stuck up job. Started the GMAT journey and in a span of 3 years, gave 5 unsuccessful GMAT attempts, never crossing 660 (Might have been the darkest phase in my life. More on this in another post). When I had almost accepted my fate, I made the decision to give one final shot - the GRE. Did some research and understood that GRE Quant was definitely easier than GMAT - so this aspect was not an issue. However, vocab was definitely a challenge, but I was ready to spend couple of months to build and polish vocab. 2020 : with Magoosh word list and tried to memorize 100 words each day. However, I noticed that I couldn't retain the meanings beyond a week or so. For quant, went through the general topics and Manhattan books.  2020 : with the prep in a cursory manner. Never had the heart to give a mock as an unexpectedly low score would have put a stop to the prep. Went through the OG, Verbal and Quant Review. 2020 : much persuasion from family and my dear God-send, angelic husband, decided to give GRE a full throttle effort. Sometime in mid October, I came across u/gregmat and how I thank God for creating such an amazing human!! After going through few of his Verbal Strategy videos, I subscribed to GregMat+ and followed the 1 month study plan. 2020 : on Big Book tests and worked on weakness areas. For Verbal it was mostly not understanding the big picture and Quant was mainly silly mistakes. Went through all of Greg's strategy videos for TC and RC and practiced these strategies forcibly in practice questions. Guys - this might sound lame or repetitive or even obvious, but as Greg mentions in his videos, it is imperative to force your brain to come out of old habits while solving questions and meaningfully apply the strategies.  2021 :  started seeing increase in accuracy in RC and TC questions post applying Greg's strategies.

Went with the attitude of whatever happens - happens.  Day :  had the exam booked for 1 PM IST as I'm not a morning person and my brain works at peak in the afternoon. Faced issues with mic (inspite of passing the system requirements check) and the proctor asked me to either get another laptop or reschedule the exam. Luckily, I had my amazing superhero brother at home who lended his laptop. This took about 30-35 minutes and after passing all system requirements, the proctor asked me show the room, table, chair and whiteboard. We started the exam around 1.45 and had no hiccups for the next 2 hours. The issue and argument essays were quite straightforward and I managed to put in 550-600 words with strong 4-5 paragraphs. I had QVQVQ (thank the Lord!! ) which immediately boosted my confidence (being a non native speaker and an Indian engineer, Quant has been my strong suite). I did not try to figure which Quant was experimental. Verbal was very similar to the Paid PowerPrep tests (bit harder than the free ETS tests). Did not find mind boggling vocabulary - the GRE tests usage of a specific word in context to the whole sentence. Hence, usually one needs to understand the nuances instead of extremely hard vocabulary. However, I had gone through GregMat's 28 vocab videos and revised them once every week. Quant was on par with the Paid tests. However, as I already had GMAT quant practice, I'm really not sure how reflective my opinion would be. (Had consistently been scoring 49-51 in GMAT). test did stop abruptly atleast 5 times due to network issues and 3 more times by the proctor to perform a random room check. I was aware of these issues previously, but was more comfortable to give the GRE at home, to be in a familiar environment to give my nerves some peace.  forward 5 hours and the score displayed on screen was  - V160 Q166 a second, I thought I was hallucinating and tried to focus my dazed out eyes on the screen. But it was there as clear as day - a score that exceeded my expectations. piece of advice to those who are loosing their lives after these anachronistic standardized tests - please DON'T.

1,"Verbal is at 164-165; if I could get Quant to that value I would be very happy. my first Manhattan practice test last August and scored Q157. It's been pretty consistent since. I've practiced 6-8 hours a week since, focused on quant. I did the entire 5 lb Manhattan prep book cover to cover, \~20% of the big book problems, official GMAT quant book, the corpus of gregmat videos and even Vince's LinkedIn course and Khan Academy's math series. I have purchased and will do the official ETS books over the next month or two.  I got problems wrong, I made ""process"" flash cards. For example, if I see two variables, I quickly know to consider setting up a system of equations. I only miss ""very hard"" and ""hard"" problems, (particularly ones that involve combining lots of different strategies and convoluted wording) and seem to have challenges in managing my time on problems like these. I think my struggle has gradually shifted from not knowing how to do problems to struggling with time pressure in an exam setting -- I always time myself when I am doing practice problems. Often, I will stubbornly solve the problem algebraically (and get it right) but spend more time than is economical in the process, when I could have just used the calculator instead. 

  
Given the above, I aim to spend the next few weeks ""digesting"" my Manhattan prep tests by trying to get better at working under time pressure.

1,"Hi all, this post is both for seeking advice and sharing my experience. had prepared for GRE for around 2-3 months and wrote GRE twice. Both times I wasn't satisfied with my scores, since my academics otherwise are exceptional and I know I could have done better in GRE and most of the universities I'm applying to are very competitive. In my first attempt, scored between *306-310 with AWA = 5*, and in my second attempt there was a *5 point increase,* scoring between *311-315 (Q:160, V:151-155, AWA:5)*. At this point given the amount of time I had committed, I am frustrated and burnt out.  had used the Magoosh online material and I had religiously followed the content and *solved all* the questions Magoosh had provided (*YES, WHEN I SAW ALL, I LITERALLY MEAN EVERY SINGLE QUESTION*) and watched the video explanation for every question when I had a doubt, even if I got it correct. I even constantly mailed them, seeking advice and tips but most of the time they replied back with very generic responses and templates they already had. They also used to provide me with links to their blogs. The only thing which I didn't use regularly were the vocab flash cards app (which I've heard and think is good). I don't want to further spend my time using their material because when I prepared for those many months, I spend almost 5-7 hours everyday studying for GRE and solving questions. And yes, during my second attempt my score did improve by 5 points but I didn't refer to the Magoosh material after my first attempt and used content found online and worked a bit on improving my vocab. Personally I don't think the Magoosh questions prepare you for the difficult sections (in both my GRE attempts I did very well in the first quant section, but in my second quant section as the questions got harder I struggled, bringing my score down) and they don't have that great tips for verbal. was my experience with Magoosh prep. Others experience may differ. It just didn't work out for my score expectations.* ADVICE:*** I wanted to know what I'm doing wrong or if I'm referring to the wrong material or so.

I know the last part takes a lot of practice and dedication, so if you all can let me know of any resources to refer to, I'd appreciate that. Quant, I struggle with the harder questions and verbal, I would say all especially RC, so any tips would be appreciated. people say that you don't need to spend more than 3 months preparing for GRE and given the amount of time I've already spent, I don't think I want to spend more than 1-1.5 months studying again because I definitely would like to spend my time working on other things. **I'd recently come across GregMat and his one month GregMat+ study plan**. *Can someone provide feedback about this plan and how good the teaching is,* and whether it would work for me or if it's needed. And also, along with the GregMat+ plan, should I be referring to other resources also like the Manhattan 5lb book, Kaplan or anything.  other prep material recommendations are also welcome.

1,"Hey friends. Recently I gave it my full effort while studying for and taking the GRE. I got a 330, better than any mock test score I'd gotten. I'm sharing some learnings which may help you. When I stopped caring about the final score, and instead focused on doing my utter best at each question, my score went up and my stress went down naturally. The target score is just a favorable outcome - your intent should be to solve each question to the best of your ability. I can't demand the best possible score from the test, but I can demand the best possible effort from myself. I had a motto for each section. I analyzed what kind of mistakes I made in each section to create the mottos. When each section began, I actively reminded myself of the motto. For quant, it was 'Periodically Stop, for real'. For verbal it was, 'When confused, read carefully, read the context, and understand'. For AWA it was 'Don't think too hard, write simply and write a conclusive paragraph'. This shaped my approach and minimized the possible mistakes. I gave tests. I did everything I could do at home to mimic the foreign-ness and discomfort of the actual test. I gave mock tests in a different location and at a different PC than normal. I set the AC to very cold. I wore the sweater and the jeans I'd wear on exam day. I gave up my habit of drinking water every half an hour. I would have worn a mask while studying too, if I knew we had to wear em. were my top 3 tips. I'll share my methods now. Studied all Gregmat vocab videos, and all Magoosh decks of Common Words and Basic. and Verbal: Solved all questions from all 3 ETS books. At that time, I made sure to note down the question numbers of the ones I got wrong, and whether it was a silly mistake. After finishing all the available questions, I again solved the ones I had gotten wrong the first time around. This ensured I didn't make the same mistakes again. RC, I used Gregmat's 'Simplification on Steroids' and 'Some Words are more important'. After much practice, I could do it in my head and no longer had to write down the meaning of each sentence. Quant, I solved the entire Manhattan sections for the topics I was not strong in. I used Gregmat's strategy called 'Periodically Stop' to prevent silly mistakes. This worked well. exam day, I had gotten just 3 hours of sleep due to stress. I knew I wasn't physically at my best - but I had decided I would give it my best effort. I was about to panic during the test when my first quant section went badly - I was intimidated by the real difficulty of GRE quant. But I steadfastly did my best. And you know what, lady luck favored me because that section was the unscored one. No way I could have done so well otherwise. miscellaneous tips: Remember: the GRE is a standardized test. The questions will be quite similar to the official test prep material.  Take several mock tests. I only gave the 4 free ETS tests, one Manhattan test, and one Princeton test. It sufficed for me.  Know which state your 4 free universities are in. The invigilators won't tell you even if you ask nicely lol.","How I scored a 330 despite many challenges, &amp; advice for fellow test-takers.",1611667218,17,664,1

1,"Finished the GRE a few hours ago and wanted to give my impression.  My test was ordered QVQVQ which I was initially dreading but as it turns out, was for the best.  My prep focused almost entirely on quant.  My mock score before prep was 159Q/162V (ETS guide).  Scores continued to rise and was scoring  in the 165-168 range in both V and Q before giving the exam.  I'm not particularly strong in either area but I'm also not weak.   Q was manageable and very ETS-esque like.  Lot's of standard problems written in ways to trip you up.  Know how to handle %s and ratios  - they're all over the place.  I finished this section with about 7 mins to spare and went back through a second time but I didn't end up changing any of my answers.  2nd Q - which was almost certainly experimental, seemed more like a Manhattan test than ETS.  The questions didn't seem to have the normal shortcuts and were more calculation and less logic.  I didn't have any time to spare on this section because of a couple calculation intensive problems but I also didn't feel that rushed.  Third Q was tough but again very much like powerpreps and not appreciably harder.  I had about 3 mins to spare and checked through my responses but didn't change any answers.  I was pretty confident in most of my answers on all of the quant except parts of section 2- experimental (I think).     was a total nightmare.  The first V section felt harder than any of the hard 2nd sections of the powerpreps and I tried them all (free versions floating around).  Passages were long and super dense and just made my head spin.  I seriously just wanted to quit after reading the one passage for the third time and not absorbing a single fricking thing and I think the only thing that kept me going was knowing I killed it on the first quant section.  2nd verbal was much easier and I finished it with about 10 mins to spare.  This was the first time I didn't get the hard 2nd section for verbal that I can recall.   scores: 168Q (very happy)  158V (shocked)  I definitely feel like I could do better but I'm not going to try.    used Manhattan 5 pound and their 6 tests.  I used Greg Mat for the essays.  I also did a ton of problems on GMAT club and GRE club which I feel more than prepared me for the quant.  Also all the official ETS stuff. Prep was over 2 months.

1,"I first started for the GRE just for a little bit back in July 2020, but then had to take a hiatus from studying in September since the semester got a bit busy for me. Then I returned back to studying for the GRE for real and more seriously that time around (since my summer studying was just a bit casual since I was going to take the GRE a bit later in the year or even at the beginning of the following year anyways) just last month. For studying, I used Vince Kotchian's [1-month GRE study plan]( to do my actual and serious GRE studying since I had about a month to prepare for the GRE.  I took my first official GRE exam ever in a testing center a bit less than an hour away from home. For me, the exam went QVQVQ, and I think the experimental section of my exam was the first quantitative section for sure as the questions there were a bit rougher than what I was used to in practice Powerprep exams and even in comparison to the rest of the quantitative questions of the exam.  aside from the experimental quantitative section (or what I thought was the experimental section of the test), I thought that the rest of the quantitative questions on the exam (the ones from the second and third quantitative sections) were somewhat easy. I wouldn't say too easy (that feels so arrogant and like underestimating for sure), but in terms of difficulty, I would say, they were like 9th/10th-grade difficulty level with the Algebra, Geometry, and Basic Probability and Statistics content presented on the exam. Also, maybe it has to do with preparing with the right materials since I got to practice some ""hard"" quantitative questions in the last two weeks of my GRE studying or the math major advantage, but the ""hard"" questions on the GRE or the questions that were supposed to be presented as ""hard"" on the exam weren't that hard actually; I would say that you have to do a bit more calculation and thinking compared to other quantitative questions on the exam as the calculations from the last quantitative section took up a huge majority of my scratch paper (lol), but not too bad if your math foundation is pretty strong.  the title indicates, I did pretty well (in terms of standards) on the Quantitative section, and I have ambivalent thoughts about it: I'm glad that I got over 165 as a score and could be a possible shining factor on my applications, but at the same time, the (semi-)perfectionist side of me just wants to flip a table since I'm just 1 point off from getting a perfect score. :3  prep materials, I used a bit of Kaplan to get a head start to know the type of content that would appear on the exam (though I do not highly recommend using it for practice questions tbh), but mainly Manhattan Prep 5 lbs (which is actually a tad harder than the actual questions IMO since I would sometimes screw over the questions in the book due to silly mistakes lol) and Math Strategies books, ETS Official Quantitative Reasoning and Study Guide books, GREdge, and GregMat (thanks Google for the latter two).  for the verbal, it was actually easier than I thought it would turn out, and though I spent a good amount of my prep time both casually (in the summer) and hardcore (since a month ago) studying vocabulary from Barron and GregMat since my vocabulary is pretty mediocre tbh, turned out that I didn't really need it that much tbh as the vocabulary presented in the exam was just medium-ish level IMO. If any of y'all took the old SAT before 2016 (I took both new and old SAT btw lol), I would say that the verbal section of the GRE is very similar to the reading/verbal section of the old SAT with the vocabulary and reading sections of the former a bit easier IMO. Although it as an actual exam I was doing and there was limited time to finish the questions (well I finished them anyways lol), I actually enjoyed the passages that I got to read in the exam and got to learn a few new things today that I didn't even know until now...maybe I should call ETS to give me all the works/passages that they used in all of their exams so I can read more, how about that? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  the title indicates, my verbal score was just okay: not that outstanding in contrast to the other verbal scores presented in this subreddit (let's  pretend that I'm not in envy of the 160+ verbal scores, okay? :3), but not too bad either considering that I started with a 150 verbal score in my first Powerprep exam, had about a month to study, and it was indeed my first official GRE exam ever (also verbal has always been my weakness as well lol). For prep materials, I used a bit of Manhattan Prep to get a head start on the big picture of the verbal section, but mainly ETS Official Verbal Reasoning and Study Guide books, and Vince Kotchian and GregMat videos for strategies (again thank you, Google for the latter two).  the writing section, which was the first section of the exam, it wasn't too bad at all except I didn't get to finish my Issue Essay since I took a bit too much time on the first body paragraph rip as I was trying to finish a sentence when the timer went off (I wonder if an incomplete sentence will hold against you in terms of scoring, but at least I had a counterargument paragraph as my last paragraph of my issue essay lol). The argument essay went fine actually and I got to finish a bit before time ran out. While my official writing score hasn't come out yet since it does take time to grade the essays, I would predict I would maybe get a 4 or 4.5 score on the writing section of the GRE...maybe a hopeful 5 since in the last Powerprep (Plus) exam I took just last week, I didn't even finish my Issue Essay either, and I still got a 5 score on the writing section of the essay as determined by the computer section lol (my highest average yet was a 5.5 in my first Powerprep Plus practice exam lol). However, I used political examples in my Issue Essay so I hope that it doesn't affect my score badly for the Issue essay lol (you know how touchy people get when it comes to politics lol). To prepare for the writing section of the essay, I watched GregMat, and I would definitely say they help me very much, thank you. :)  yea, super long, but overall, not too bad of an experience, and pretty good score for first time around for an official GRE exam (pretty good quantitative score and ***slightly*** above-average verbal score albeit underwhelming compared to the 160+ verbal scores out there lol), and I don't think I have to take the GRE again considering the programs that I will be applying to: for future plans, I am planing on pursuing a masters in either Applied Statistics, Computational and Applied Mathematics, and/or Data Science in either University of Houston, UT Dallas, University of Washington, Boston University, Colorado State University, University of Colorado, UT Austin etc. with University of Houston and (maybe) Boston University as my top choices actually. My GPA is meh actually (3.27) as a double Computer Science and Math major in a Public Ivy (UT Austin), so I do hope that my decent total GRE score, especially a pretty good GRE Quantitative score, can compensate for that. :/",154V 169Q on my first official GRE this morning,1610861445,9,1485,1

* A little bit dum with high expectation from life guys. I have taken the GRE exam on January 6. I have prepared for almost 6 months starting from July 2020. I took PP1 as soon as I started preparing and got my **first score of 299 (V141, Q158).** My goal was to get above 330+ since I had a mediocre GPA. So, I focused on this besides everything else. I worked religiously for 5 hours every day. As you can see from the table below, I had made quite an improvement for the first 2 months but then literally hit the ceiling. No matter how many hours I have put into it my score didn't rise above 320+. And finally, on judgment day I got a similar score that I had been getting. Although I have enjoyed studying, I just wish I didn't put that much time into it. I see the last 4 months as a waste since they had no impact on my GRE score.  img tatl7qpug9b61...* have I learned:** I think your very first mock test tells a lot about your GRE score. From what I have seen from the posts shared on this subreddit, people who get 330+ usually have a higher first mock score. For instance, that one guy who scored 335, had 325 at his first mock test. So, if you are not a native who doesn't live in an English-speaking country and score somewhere around 300 don't expect to score above 330+ just by studying hard. Yes, there could be some exceptions but it is true for most cases.  realistic goals:** Be honest with yourself and set realistic scores otherwise you will feel like crap after not getting your desired score. In my case, I have refused an internship offer which could have been great for me since I just graduated but having high hopes made me believe that 330+ is feasible.  spent studying:** Quantitative: 183 hours

At first the proctor talked out loud to me, but by the end I'm assuming that he was talking out loud to somebody else and only typed instructions to me through the chat. My laptop made an alert noise so I noticed that chats. Aside from that, everything on the exam went about like what I'd expect at an in-person testing center. The proctor walked me through all the steps very clearly. thoughts: I'm in STEM, so I was really hoping more for a high Quant than a high Verbal, but I'm content!

1,"I’m so thankful for this community, so I wanted to give back by telling you all what ended up working for me during my (very long) journey to increasing my quant score. important background. I took my first test under the regular time limits in June and got a 139 in the quant section. This didn't super-surprise me, as I work in communications and was never amazing at math. I also have a rare learning disability called non-verbal learning disorder. It's the opposite of what it sounds like - I learn best through words and have trouble with visual-spatial processing. I also have ADHD. I was younger, I gave up on math, but as I've gotten older and talked with more specialists who understand the disability, I learned that some people with this disability can learn math, it just takes them longer. For my grad program, I needed to score better in order to qualify for scholarships. I also wanted to prove that I could do it. Lastly, given the pandemic, I had lots more free time and monetary resources to devote to this test.  first secured accommodations for myself, (time and a half), which involved me sending in a neurologist report from when I was 6, a similar report from when I was 10, a similar story from two years ago, and contact information for my psychiatrist. (They didn't contact him.) I received the accommodations about a month and a half later. taking the test in June, I started with Gregmat materials, but I couldn't keep up. My foundation wasn't there. Therefore, I switched to the Manhattan Prep Math Strategies book. Highly recommend it for those of you who have a weak foundation! I also used Vince Kotchian’s Khan Academy guide for prep. I leisurely went through these two resources over the course of 2.5 months. Then, I went through the official GRE guide. I found that I had made a lot of math foundation improvements, but kept falling for ETS traps. I didn't time myself during this phase at all. It often took me 15 minutes to solve single problems, but I learned a lot with this approach.  I switched back to Gregmat and completed his one month course for math. I needed additional practice problems too, so I completed about half of the Manhattan 5 pound math problems as I went through his course. He is the master at spotting ETS traps! The 5 pound book problems helped reinforce his strategies. This phase too took me about 2.5 months.  dreaded taking practice tests and took the PP1 on a whim and did shockingly well (166). I decided to take the test on a whim—a big mistake. I didn't realize how much harder the real test is than the free practice tests! I also had to get up early to drive to the testing center which didn't help. I got a 155, but resolved to take the test again in a month. What they say on this forum was true - the current GRE math problems are MUCH wordier and require more calculations than the old ETS materials.  the last month, I uses Target Test Prep. It's expensive, but worth it for targeted prep for your week areas. I only got through 20% of the course, but it really helped me. I decided to take my retest at home. It wasn't smooth at first - it took me 45 minutes to connect with a proctor. But after that, it was smooth sailing. I almost cried when I saw my score!  spent 6 months and 366.5 months studying for one section, which sounds crazy. But getting a 160Q... It was priceless. NO JUST KIDDING I SPENT $950ISH in test prep and test rescheduling. Don't let anyone else tell you raising your scores in the dramatic manner I did is free, especially if you have a learning disability. I worked my ass off, but I also am lucky enough to have a full time job right now and lots of free time.

And due to that, they couldn't find enough time to attempt all the questions, ending up, unfortunately, guessing the last few questions of the section. you that these test takers have been scoring 165+ in the quant section of the ETS PowerPrep mock tests (most of them being in the engineering background with a strong hold in mathematics) and then end up scoring 155-165 in the actual GRE test.  many of them have suggested to get used to ""timed practice"" ie. practice a set of 20 questions (from any resource, like Manhattan, since many of us are using it) with a timer of 30 min. would be really grateful if y'all could share your thoughts regarding the same with respect to preparation strategy.

1,"So this morning I gave my gre at testing center. The sequence was VQVQV. Extremely disappointed with my Quant score. My main mistake was not to do enough timed practice. It doesn’t matter if you are math genius or not, doing timed practice will define your score. Did well in first section and thus got hard second section. It was not hard in terms of concept and calculation but were very time consuming. Lots and lots of language. I could solve all the problems with more time but since I neglected practicing in timed environment, I ran out of time. I had to guess the last 6 questions. So to all the people, if you want good score then practice and practice with timer.  verbal, the score was on the predicted range. Gregmat is gold so subscribe him or follow him on YouTube. Didn’t memorize any words. Was too lazy to practice any significant number of RC questions. Just kept his advice in mind and tried to use them in exam. Since I am STEM program applicant didn’t really focus on verbal.  used ets materials and Manhattan book and was on and off with studies from October. Only studied real hard in last 2 weeks. You can use gre big book for verbal. For Math I found the big book too easy and the real gre questions were definitely harder. Manhattan is fine for refreshing your math concept. Other than that ETS is best and should be your main source. more time, GRE is not testing your math or english skill but your time management, attention to detail and analytical skill which you can definitely be improved with practice. Don’t be negligent like me. I messed up but people reading this can definitely do better with routine and structured practice. I wish all of you the best.",Gave GRE this morning.

1,"Hi There -  just finished the at home / proctorU version of the GRE today and received a 160 on Quant and 160 on Verbal. To be honest, I'm not that happy with the quant score as I was consistently testing around 163-165 on my practice tests (using Manhattan Prep / Princeton Review).  first quant section was a breeze and I finished with 3/4 minutes to review. The second one was a different story altogether, and was significantly harder and I could tell I wasn't going to do well.  prep was adequate at best: I only decided to take the GRE about 4 weeks ago, and my preparation was almost entirely cramming last minute. I do not recommend this approach.  question is: I am applying to grad programs in applied data science (MS degree, typically in engineering schools). Given that the GRE is optional this year for most schools, my thinking was I could take it and ace the quant (which I unfortunately didn't), or just submit an application without my GRE score. Now that I have a Q:160, I'm in a bit of a dilemma. Do I submit my GRE, setting me apart from those applicants who submit NO GRE at all even though it's a lower score (especially for engineering programs)? Or do I just not submit at all?

Also, please don’t take my disappointment in my scores to heart if you have different goals. coming up on almost a year of studying for the GRE. That’s right- a year. I would say 6 months of that was serious study where I was studying nightly for a few hours and on weekends for 4-5 hours. I took a test in July and scored 151 quant 157 verbal. I knew it was going to be bad but I wanted to get the first test out of the way. After studying since then I just took the GRE and scored 152 quant and 154 verbal. This isn’t surprising since my PP scores were around this but slightly higher, so I’m not sure what I was expecting. I’m absolutely gutted and pretty much at my breaking point. I feel like I’m burning my resources and my time and mental stability.  terms of studying I took the Manhattan prep in person course in January (bad idea bc it was before I truly learned concepts), and have been using ETS and GregMat videos since and been focusing on strategy. I just can’t believe I’ve pretty much had no improvement in 6 months of studying. When studying I am clear in strategies, but I guess it all does to crap when I take the exam.

1,"Hello everyone! currently been studying off and on for the GRE for over half a year.  I did not have any  intentions to take the exam anytime soon when I started.  I mainly began studying because I was honestly very bored at home (pandemic) and needed something to do with my brain.   basically have been doing a lot of work on vocabulary with flashcards.  I’ve been making my own flashcards on Anki using the Powerscore Repeat Offenders list and have been studying them daily.   I’ve also been doing some material review for the quantitative section using the Manhattan Prep Math Strategies book.   I recently decided that I might want to take the GRE this upcoming summer to get it over with early and because I know I’ll have the time to study these next eight months.  That’s when I found GregMat!  I got the GRE prep books on his recommended list to use a few weeks ago including the three ETS books in the Super Power Pack and the Manhattan Prep 5lb book to study from in addition to the Manhattan Prep Math Strategies book I’ve been using already.  I might abandon the Manhattan Prep Math Strategies book as it isn’t on his recommended resources list.   week, I’ve began officially studying.  I’ve been continuing to work on vocabulary flashcards to continue to build my vocabulary knowledge, been working through the GRE ETS Math Review, and watching Greg MAT’s wonderful walkthroughs for the GRE ETS Math Review.   thing is...  I don’t know what to do next now after the math review.  Should I watch all of GregMat’s videos?  Should I begun going through the official ETS practice problems?  Should I start practicing the quantitative questions in the Manhattan Prep 5lb book?   have this concern that if I start doing the official ETS practice problems too early, I might be “wasting” practice questions because I’m not ready for them (mainly for quantitative reasoning).  I’m also wondering if there’s a timeline one should take the GRE in after studying or if there’s such a thing as studying too early for the GRE.  Like if I study these next 8 months, and decide not to take the GRE yet (I’m still very early in my undergraduate degree) will I be wasting time studying and resources (all the practice questions I exposed myself too)?  Will the resources not be as effective when I study them again before I do actually end up sitting my exam? thoughts and advice is appreciated.

Quant: I am sorry, but I cannot be of much help here because maths has always been my strong subject, my bachelor's subject needs me to have a strong quant always.
BUT I will recommend everyone who is stuck in the *163-165 slump* to watch Gregmat's quant videos to get tricks which save time. That way you can revise tricky questions at the end to save silly mistakes (I caught two mistakes this way in my final exam).  I started with Magoosh words [list]( in June this year, but I didnt finish it because it was too bland for me &gt;_&gt; I am a classic procrastinator oops &gt;.&lt;
I started studying properly just two weeks before my exam date, and Gregmat's lists (all_all_all with 800 words) were a GINORMOUS help. And for those who are fellow procrastinators, a *tip*: practice with a friend on call. Make them listen to your meanings for the words in the list, and then keep writing down words you forget. 
For reading passages, you need to go through the hit and trial process and see what works out best for you. I tried both Gregmat's tricks and The Tested Tutor's (Youtube) tricks and in the final exam, I used a mix of them both. you SO much /u/gregmat, 155 is my best verbal score and 170 my (obviously) best quant score, including PP1, PP2 and Manhattan test. Writing: I practiced for two days using Gregmat's guidance, and it worked well for me, for others it might take maybe a little bit more time for practice, idk. Just make sure to practice writing atleast two times each for the Issue and the Argument essays, to get a hang of what you can write. I also read a few sample essays on the internet which also gave me a few ideas on how I can structure my writing. calm my nerves on exam day, I watched Gregmat's verbal walkthroughs, which I also implemented in my final exam. Helped me a lot, but it can be different for others, so please use hit and trial for your strategy for attempting the questions.  I gave my test at home: my ProctorU experience was fine. 
Since I am diabetic, I told the Proctor before the exam started that I would want to leave the room during the break to get something to eat, and they were okay with it. But do make sure to come back before your 10 minutes are up, since the proctor has to recheck the room when you're back, and that may take a few minutes.

Therefore, governments should fund most scientific research projects without regard for their possible consequences. has to admit that advancement in science has not always been a force for good. History is rife with examples of research and discoveries whose fruits have been abused by mad men towards their quest for power, control, and harm, and scientific advancements that led to harmful unintended consequences. For instance, recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have only made the job of arresting and silencing political dissidents easier for authoritarian regimes. Surely, accurate contact tracing and geographically locating people was not possible without the recent advancements in science. Moreover, scientific experiments that go wrong usually lead to more new problems than solutions for old ones. A research facility that is trying to discover new treatments for a disease that affects a small proportion of the population, could damage the entire planet should a dangerous contagion escape the facility and infect a vast human population. most scientific discoveries eventually lead to betterment of mankind and improving people's living condition. In recent years many theoretical scientific principles of the past have found a way into the realm of practice and helped usher in new innovations. For example, the binary system of numbers has existed for hundreds of years, without any obvious practical benefit. However, with the advent of computer technology in the 20th century, the binary system proved to be the most efficient language for machines. Another example of such belated beneficial consequences is the discredited field of Alchemy. Of course, Alchemy is a mythical and inconsequential field of knowledge to a modern scholar. However, recent advancements in chemistry and medicine would not have been possible had the alchemist of the past given up on their attempts to turn lead into gold due to a lack of obvious results. in many instances research that seems to have immediate consequences that are horrific, leads to phenomenal advancement after the passage of time. A good example of such research is the Manhattan Project; the US government's quest to build the first atomic bomb and decisively win the Second World War. The immediate aftermath of this project was mass destruction and horrific diseases and decades of life under the threat of nuclear annihilation. However, the discovery that nuclear power can be harnessed to supply civilization with clean, cheap, and reliable energy would not have been possible without first developing the atomic bomb, or abandoning nuclear research after observing the devastating early consequences. The same principle holds true about Nazi Germany’s investment into war technology that led to the creation of the V2 rocket. This rocket, initially created to give Germany a destructive advantage, later led to the very rockets that put human beings on the moon and hundreds of beneficial satellites in the earth’s orbit. sum up, it is very important for governments to support and fund scientific research. Even though some research might lead to uncertain or terrible immediate consequences, most scientific discoveries eventually serve to improve mankind’s living condition and well-being.","Issue essay sample, feedback and tips are appreciated",1608295364,9,632,1
1,"Hey all, my GRE is on 24th. I am going to do the free ets tests in between and see my score. For now, I have done three magoosh practice tests and the scores are as below. I finished Manhattan 5lb before starting magoosh. Did around 70% of quant in magoosh and all of the verbal questions. My score estimate in quant is showing 158-163 and for verbal 161-166. The verbal is a bit inflated I think because I had some repeating questions so the more probable estimate would be 158-163 as well. 1: Q 159 V 158
Test 2: Q 161 V 163
Test 3: Q 163 V 165 last one had about 5/6 repeating questions of which I think I would have gotten max 4 right if they were new to me, so consider Q as 162 and V 161/162. am a bit worried for quant as I can't seem to get near 165.

1,"Warning: Long post. Mostly a rant... but also, please help. I am lost!  
 originally started my entire study journey with GMAT last summer (2019), got bogged with work and stopped studying. Decided in 2020 summer that I will study for the GRE instead because it's supposedly easier and my starting point was already at average. I started with the score 148V and 152Q. I need to score quite high 330+ to make up for my low GPA for a top ten MBA program.  started studying back in July with the idea that if I study diligently for a few months I increase my score slowly and steadily to 155s, 160s, and more. I began my journey with Magoosh and watched all their math videos, took copious notes, and did about half the problems. I focused much more on quant than on verbal since I am ""stronger"" in quant. Did this till about October. Took another test and got 150V and 150Q. Somehow my quant score went down?   
 then decided to seek out a tutor, which has been a roller coaster of it's own. Most of them said that however I have been studying wasn't very good and I'll need to start all over again if I am truly gunning for 330+. So I got a tutor, paid way too much money, and started with the Manhattan Series. Finished all those books. I simultaneously use Gregmat because it's just too good to not use. Mid way through my tutor time I took another test and scored 154V and 154Q. I wasn't really excited because I thought by now I MUST be getting closer to 160s!!!! I was truly lacking in vocab. For some reason I have had the hardest time trying to memorize words... Maybe my long term memory is shot? I forget things pretty quickly. Then after the Manhattan Series, I decided that I am just going to follow Gregmat's 1 month plan (about 3 weeks ago). That really showed me my weak points. I've been focusing on this a lot more, but now my issue is timing. If I had time I seem to be able to get things right, but doing everything fast, knowing all that vocab, somehow also doing verbal, and learning more math is so freakin challenging!!   
 have been on this journey all while working full time. I have read every reddit article on how folks score so well and tried everything under the sun. My verbal sucks completely. I get almost every SC and SE question wrong. I'm not terrible at RCs (\~60-75% correct). Took another Kaplan test and scored 148v and 148q. That was the point I really wanted to bang my head against the wall.   
 my test is in a week and I really want to use my time wisely. I just need some guidance. I am so freakin lost and don't know what to do anymore.**",What am I doing wrong,1607883102,5,564,1
1,"Prep: Magoosh: 
   * Pros: least expensive, UI is similar to that of the actual GRE, practice questions with timer
   * Cons: Questions are not representative of GRE; Quant is too calculation focused, Verbal is too vocab focused
   * Remark: I think Magoosh is best suitable for the initial stage of prep. I attempted about half of the questions.
* Manhattan Prep 5lb - Quant only: A must do in my opinion! 
* Magoosh GRE Vocabulary Flashcards App: Has a good collection of words.
* ETS official material:
   * Official Quant practice
   * Official Verbal practice
   * Official Guide to the GRE
   * Math Review (Must do! It's free)
* Greg mat AWA videos: Following a set structure helps save a lot of time! 
* List of free mock tests:
   * ETS powerprep 1, 2
   * 4 Princetonreview tests (Used a library book)
   * 1 Kaplan
   * 1 Manhattanprep Take as many mock tests as you can. GRE is a LONG test that requires a high level of alertness throughout. I got QVQVQ and I barely finished my last section and looks like I made a mistake or two as well - not because the questions were wildly difficult, it's just that I was exhausted by then. 
* GRE tests your equanimity! I am the last person who should be giving this advice (I gave the GRE with an empty stomach because I couldn't bring myself to eat!) But, this is 100% true. If you are nervous then you will make mistakes and lose speed. Personally, the test center environment really helped keep calm - somehow seeing the staff be perform their routine kind of made me feel like it was a regular day for me too!
* Be active on this sub-reddit! I have come across a lot of useful information here and sometimes received much needed support. Being a part of a community is always a big positive! Journey: I had to reschedule my GRE test 4 times! If COVID19 had reached my city one week later, I would have been done with the GRE back in March. Instead, it dragged on till December. Not only did I have to spend time preparing again and again, I was constantly worried about it and couldn't really start new activities.
* GRE is one single data point in an application, and in my field (CS) most applicants have a great GRE score. Since I don't have any research experience or extensive industrial experience getting into the programs that I like still seems tough.
* Because of these reasons I started stressing as soon as my GRE was over. It seems that you will always be stressed about something. I am trying to be more positive and worry less and was reminded how reading good testing experiences often lifted my spirits during the prep.

1,"Hi guys, this group has been very useful for my test preparation and I hope this reflection on my experience can be similarly helpful to some.  took approximately 6 weeks of dedicated studying (4-5 hours/day) which I thought to be the right amount of time. I believe that it is important to try to condense preparation without having to cram at the last minute. I cannot overemphasize the importance of organizing a schedule in advance and sticking to it (try to keep the schedule light in your last week of prep).  the vocab, I relied on the Magoosh flashcards but skipped the Advanced decks as I felt that my time could be better spent consolidating higher yield words. I also supplemented the Magoosh cards with Gregmat's list of 800 words. For reading comprehension, I only went over the questions in the official guide as I regularly read GRE level reading in my everyday life. However, I did realize that I was making mistakes on 'easy' questions and I noticed that that was maybe because naturally strong readers tend to make inferences as they read and these assumptions may be ""out of scope"" as far as ETS is concerned.  dedicated most of my study time to the quant section because my background is in medicine and I haven't done math in awhile. For this, I solved the problems in the Manhattan book and ETS books.  I also did the 'Hard' questions on Magoosh. I think Magoosh gives a good idea of some of the harder questions that may appear on the test and got me used to timed computer-delivered questions. 2 weeks before my exam, I decided to subscribe to Gregmat+ and went over the quant concept videos to make sure I had covered the important concepts. Gregmat is great at helping you understand what ETS is looking for in their questions and avoiding silly mistakes. For me personally, his quant strategies of back solving and plugging numbers do not work. I think it is very easy to get flustered using these strategies because they require trial and error and I prefer the certainty that comes with solving problems algebraically, but that is just my own opinion and credit to greg for not insisting that his preferred strategies work for everyone.  the writing section, Gregmat's videos were really helpful to get an idea of how to outline the essays. I thought the video on the argument essay was especially useful while the issue essay video was *slightly* misleading. This is because the prompt he answers in the issue video is arguably one of the easier prompts to approach, with countless examples from science and research that one can think of. There are however many ""boring"" prompts in the ETS pool where it is much more difficult to draw from science, politics and history etc.","166V, 167Q, 5AW",1607422863,5,520,1

1,"I took the GRE today! I've been browsing around (and posting in) this subreddit for a while so I thought I'd detail some of my experience (vocabulary words bolded). Hopefully some people will benefit from at least one thing that I write here.  
\- I don't remember how long I'd been preparing. I originally **demurred** to taking the GRE and I was looking for Master's programs that didn't require it, but then I just figured I might as well take it to give me options when I applied. With that said, I didn't seriously start studying until maybe the beginning of November (if that). The past two weeks is when I was eating, sleeping, and breathing GRE videos/resources/practice questions.  
\- I bought the ETS Official Guide, Manhattan Prep 5 lb. book, ETS Verbal Reasoning Practice Questions, and ETS Quantitative Practice Questions books to do questions. Many have said that the 5 lb. book has terrible verbal questions, so I **eschewed** them.  
\- I took the PowerPrep 1 practice test on Monday and got 169V/158Q. I was **ecstatic**!... but then I realized/read that the PP1 was a bit easier than the real thing. Still, that score made me very happy. Two days later, I took the PP2 and got a 159V/162Q. My Verbal score somehow got worse than my Quant score, but I was still very encouraged because PP2 is supposed to be a good indicator of how you will on the real test, and I would definitely take that split any day.  
\- Yesterday, I told myself I would relax to avoid anxiety but part of me really wanted to study, so I compromised by reviewing vocabulary at work and then looking over some formulas at home. I actually memorized two formulas by doing this, but I would recommend you rest the night before so as to calm yourself. Day/Test Center:**  
\- I don't know if it was stress/anxiety or something I ate, but my stomach was NOT feeling good. And it was pouring rain on my way to the test center. Definitely an **inauspicious** start to the day lol. I got there maybe 15 minutes before they said to come, so I read over some notes in the car and then went inside.  
\- The guy at the front desk was a J-E-R-K! He was definitely an **officious** man; he would give unclear instructions on what to do and then **excoriate** you for not knowing what to do. Like, dude, relax. It's a friggin' test center. It wouldn't have really bothered me for the test, but he kept acting that way.  
If I had to do it again, I would consider doing the test at home to avoid all that unnecessary stress and background noise. I put on the noise-cancelling ear muffs, but I could still kind of hear people (especially THAT GUY!) behind me from time to time. It was definitely more distracting than I would have liked.  
\- As for the actual test... My two essays went really well. I thought of something I might have wanted to add to my argument essay at the end but I ran out of time so I kept it as it was. I got QVQVQ, and the first Quant section kicked my butt. I think it may have been the unscored/research section or whatever the heck it was, because that was really difficult. I ran out of time and left three questions blank and swore a little more loudly than I wanted to lol.  
\- The rest of the sections went decently well, but I almost ran out of time for nearly all the sections. I didn't see a lot of the words that I studied and there were some words that I didn't study at all. Same thing with Quant - a lot of what I studied was on the test, and there were some things that I wasn't very sure about at all.  
\- All in all, I got a 163V/155Q, which was a little worse than my PP2 performance. Still, it's right around the average score to get into good education schools, so I'm overall very pleased with the result.   
\- I kind of wish that I started studying seriously earlier. I probably could have gotten at least a 160 on both sections if I did that - let that be a lesson to anyone who is preparing to practice/study early and often. But again, I'm happy with what I got - I most likely will not be taking the test again, so that's a really good feeling! It's the end of what seems like a long, **tortuous** experience.  
\- With the Issue Essay, I feel that reading up on things and having an arsenal of things you remember will help give examples.

1,"Hey all - I’ve been a lurker on this subreddit for a bit but felt the strong need to chime in and say - if you haven’t heard of EmpowerGRE, I could not recommend checking it out any more highly. Especially if you’re having trouble with the quant section. This is not some dumb plug - I used this program for the second half of my studying and it absolutely changed my entire approach to the exam. I don’t understand why it’s not more popular or well-known.  decided to purchase it upon the recommendation of a friend after taking Manhattan Prep’s course and subsequently doing horribly on my first exam. I just took my second exam two weeks ago and thanks to EmpowerGRE my score increased my quant score by over six points. And let me stress this - I am not a math person. I did horrible in all of my math classes in school and haven’t taken one since. The quant section was the single thing that most terrified me about this exam.  approach is great for a number of reasons. I think there are four main ones, however:
-The program focuses on **strategy first.** It does not harp on memorizing formulas and arcane rules. It focuses on around 3-4 main rules that apply to all of the programs and it tries to apply them to every single question. These approaches become second nature by the end of the course.
-All of the program’s practice questions are based on ***actual GRE questions,*** mostly from the official guide. This is a MASSIVE difference from Manhattan prep and all the other  major test companies. It’s what really messed me up on my first exam. The fundamental difference between the actual GRE questions and those of the major test companies is that the GRE’s are much more abstract and creative. They are supposed to test your reasoning abilities - not necessarily your math skills. This is something that the major test companies seem to not grasp. Nearly all of the questions I took on Manhattan prep’s self guided portal were heavily mathematical in nature. EmpowerGRE’s questions are all about the abstract, big picture and somewhat convoluted approaches that are on the actual exam. 
-EmpowerGRE’s curriculum is entirely self-guided, and its based around a bunch of very short (5 minutes MAX) videos that you can pause/play/return to at your convenience. These videos are extremely well organized and there really aren’t a ton. By contrast, Manhattan Prep has more videos than any student could possibly go through over the course of their study period, and they always make you feel like you’re missing something critical. EmpowerGRE’s are short, comprehensive, and powerful. They’re all about knowing what you need to know and then moving on. 
-The energy of the instructors and their relatability. I can’t stress how important this is. The math instructor has an energy to him and his presentations that makes you want to crush the exam. He’s also just a normal, every day dude. By contrast, the instructors of many of the big test companies tend to be fairly uppity Ivy League grads who all scored 170s on their math sections and harp on consultant-driven approaches based on fancy studies about how certain strategies can maximize your score. I found this approach heavily demoralizing - it made the test feel inaccessible, and like it was a modified IQ test. The truth is that couldn’t be any further from the truth - this is a very conquer-able test if you just know the right strategies and have the right mindset.  the test is UNREAL! It’s $50 a month! Compare and contrast that with all the other companies.  - I couldn’t recommend it enough. I went from being terrified of the exam to getting amped up and scoring far higher than I thought I could. And I did it in only a month and a half! I’m sure if I had longer, I could have done even better! of luck everyone!",EmpowerGRE,1607180420,1,783,1

1,"**Background**: have a strong quantitative background because of my education and hence spent most of my time preparing for the Verbal Section. I started studying for the GRE all the way back in June, took it on November 5th, and received my official score on 14th November. I quickly realized that having a strong vocab is necessary for scoring well on the Verbal Section and spent most of my time there and practicing Reading Comprehension. didn’t want to spend any more money on ETS and GRE, so restricted myself to the free resources available. I started my prep with the ETS PowerPrep 1 in June and scored 169Q/156V. Most of the questions I got wrong were either due to vocabulary or reading comprehension. Prep:** I didn’t really touch any books for verbal prep. I solved all ETS official questions available on greprepclub and interacted with people there to understand tricks and tips. Greprepclub also allowed me to time myself pretty easily (they have a timer embedded into each question) which obviously helps a lot. For expanding vocab, I first spent a few days building some basic words and then just focused on words as they appeared in questions. For each new word encountered while practicing, I entered its meaning, link to the question with that word, and a youtube video explaining it into a spreadsheet. I went over the spreadsheet every other day and by the test day I made sure I knew all the vocab words appearing in the ETS official books at the very least. In September, this idea of maintaining a spreadsheet with words led to another mini project of analyzing which words are the most important on the GRE and articulating a resource which speeds up learning. Results from that project can be found here: [ This analysis is particularly helpful if you are short on time since it tells you the order in which you should go about learning the words. It is also helpful if you are trying to find a good way to learn these vocab words. Here are some other free resources I used to study for the verbal section: [ I also found the strategies detailed by u/gregmat for reading comprehension incredibly helpful. Prep:** I didn’t spend much time on this section since the questions I was getting wrong were mostly because of silly mistakes. I practiced some questions from the ETS official books but largely limited this to practice tests. The only advice I have here is: think twice about each question and remember that ETS is trying to trick you. If this is something you are trying to improve, I think the Manhattan Prep 5lb book is a pretty comprehensive resource. Prep:** Gregmat saved me here! I watched his two videos on the AWA the day before, wrote two timed practice essays, and went into the test. If there is one thing I regret from my GRE prep, it is not spending enough time on the AWA. Tests:** took 4 practice tests in total. Here is a good list of practice tests available - [ PowerPrep 1 (June): 169Q/156V. I felt both the verbal and the quant sections were easier than the questions on the actual test (4 days before the exam): 170Q/156V: I didn’t like this test at all to be honest. The vocab was pretty obscure and some questions didn’t make sense. I recommend not wasting time on this. I think I should have taken the ManhattanPrep test instead of this. Review (3 days before the exam): 168Q/160V: This test was a lot more realistic. Highly recommend taking it! I was a little sad about my Quant score (I was aiming for a perfect score), but most of my mistakes were again silly, so I didn’t think too much about it. PowerPrep 2 (2 days before the exam): 170Q/160V: Definitely boosted my confidence a little bit. The question difficulty was on point (for both sections). spent the last day revising vocab and expanding it to a few more words. Day:** took the test at home. The test order was VQVQV which I thought was nice since I really wanted a perfect score on Quant. I think the first Verbal was the experimental since the second one was really easy and the third one was moderate. I had a pretty decent experience besides 2 interruptions. My proctor called in on time and was quick to set my test up. The proctor interrupted in the first verbal section, saying that my camera was frozen. He fixed it in under a minute but didn’t give me any time back. I was pretty close to done so I don’t think it mattered much anyway. My second interruption happened after the test ended (while entering colleges for reporting). I asked my proctor if I could google up whether the programs I am applying to require reporting a department code, and they said I could. While googling this up, ProctorU kept getting disconnected. We resolved this by using a front camera application instead and ended the test promptly. Score:** 170Q/161V 4.5AWA. A slightly higher verbal (even 1-2 points) would have been better, but I think it's fine since the programs I am applying to look at quant more than verbal. I am pretty satisfied with my score and don’t think I could have done it without greprepclub or u/gregmat. Thank you so much! for reading my post!

1,"Hi, seeking advice on how I can improve on my GRE scores. While i've been studying on and off for some time now, I wasn't serious about it until the past few months. A few days prior to the exam date, I took both of the free Powerprep mock tests provided by ETS. The discrepancy between the two test scores was quite shocking to say the least. The first Powerprep exam (free) indicated i'd score around 160V/169Q while the second one was much more difficult for some reason and I received only 154V/156Q. I'm not exactly sure why there was such a big disparity between the two scores. Furthermore, I even took practice exams on Magoosh - as I have their subscription - and was getting in the range of 330+ combined. took my first take at the actual exam a few days ago and scored around 153V/160Q and was pretty bummed out considering the scores I was getting on my diagnostics were good. I felt like I did extremely well on Verbal but I guess that sentiment didn't carry over to the score I got. Now i'm sure the Magoosh diagnostic test scores were inflated since I had exhausted their entire question pool through practice but I did not expect this much of a disparity. Naturally i'm not very talented at standardized testing (wasn't very good at SATs either) but I expected to get much higher than what I received after putting in quite some effort. Magoosh has been my only mode of studying and I've found Magoosh questions don't really reflect ETS questions that well. What I mean by this is that the GRE quant questions are extremely verbose (especially the more difficult adaptive quant section) and I'd run out of time ultimately forcing me to guess on quite a few of them. I was completely thrown off by the difference in how much ""wordier"" the GRE questions were. planning on taking it again eventually and I wont have a detailed report of what my weaknesses are until my scores are reported.

Honestly, I feel like my approach here was a giant, hot mess—I feel like I did everything in the opposite direction and wasted weeks. **What I did at first (the wrong way):** Due to my hubris and impatience, I literally just bought the Manhattan 5LB and did practice problems every day, thinking I'd just ""learn by doing."" I also used the official GRE guide, but I didn't thoroughly read through the math review section, thinking I knew it all. I did not know it all and got screwed on the test, encountering concepts of which I had a very shallow understanding. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!
   * **Note:** A week before my first test, I took the PowerPrep Plus 1 and got 169 Q/168 V, which was very misleading because it did not reveal the gaps in my conceptual knowledge—gaps that were brutally exposed on test day! Be careful of relying too much on practice test scores...
* **My new approach:** Realizing I did not have a comprehensive or thorough enough understanding of the concepts, I read the entire math review section on the official GRE guide, and watched Khan Academy videos for the ones I was less familiar with to build conceptual understanding from the ground up. (I highly recommend the quadratics + probability sections.) Then, I impulsively got gregmat+ 2 weeks before the test and literally watched every single math concept video at 2x speed. I binged that shit like Netflix and I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH! It is a perfect mix of building conceptual understanding while being able to practice as you go. With some occasional entertainment sprinkled in.
   * My biggest caveat to u/gregmat's approach (if I may) is that he really likes to use the choosing numbers approach to solving problems. While this is extremely helpful with certain problems, I tend to prefer algebra because it gives me more security in my answers. But while I'd often solve problems using a totally different approach from him, the same conceptual knowledge guided my thinking. (So I guess a win-win?) I didn't do much here except use Magoosh's free vocabulary cards. I'd do these at night, on the subway, etc. and they really helped me get past the mid-160s hump and into high-160s territory! Once you feel like you have a decent grasp on the goal/format of the issue essay, review the official [essay topic pool]( For peace of mind, I loosely brainstormed ideas in my head for each of them, and identified any topics that I was less comfortable with (for instance, the ones about science or species conservation). Then, do a bit of reading on those areas and make sure you can come up with examples/ideas for talking points. If you have time, practice writing out a few essays under the time constraint - it will make you faster and less precious about your writing! Experience (both at home):** #1:** I got QVQVQ and it was rough. I psyched myself out leading up to the test and had way too much caffeine. I also DID NOT KNOW there was an experimental section and started overthinking about which one was experimental, and got demoralized in the last section (which was probably the real one). quant section was so much harder than I'd imagined, but to make matters worse, there were also basic concepts I had not studied: like the equation of a circle, parabola transformations, and overlapping sets. Shame! I ran out of time in every section and got caught up in time-consuming problems that probably had shortcuts I could not see at the time. at the end of my 10-min break, I had no idea how to continue the test. I was terrified to navigate away from the testing screen to hail my proctor, so I just shouted ""Hello? Hello?"" for several minutes. Tragicomic! #2:** I got VQVQV which was very fortunate, because verbal is so much easier for me and it really is a mental game. The contrast between my experience with quant this time vs. last was unbelievable. My conceptual understanding was so much stronger that I was able to look at each problem and understand right away the concept they were testing. Several times, these were concepts I recognized verbatim from gregmat+. This time, I actually had time left over in each section to double-check answers. CONCLUSION:** you for reading my long and rambling post! This subreddit helped me a lot and there are so many things I wish I had done earlier, so I'm paying it forward here. I really cannot stress enough the importance of building a strong conceptual foundation in quant. It's an investment in your test-taking abilities and you'll start to see the changes as you look at problems with a totally new perspective :) free to ask me any questions!",168 Q / 168 V / 5.5 AWA: The most important thing I learned (quant),1605110783,18,1230,1
1,"I recently finished my GRE and it was way harder than any practice test and most questions on the quant parts were by far harder than any question on the Manhattan Prep textbook (including the advanced math questions) had 3 quant section, neither of which was easy and I couldn't finish 2 at all. I think I had an average of at least 4 or 5 wrong answers per section. Anyway I still got a 163 quant which is decent. However, I was puzzled with one (of the easiest) questions - not due to its difficulty but because it demanded a technique that shouldn't appear on the GRE. I was able to recall the exact quant comparison question and here it is (please delete mod if you are afraid of copyright claims by ETS) 4x^2+28x = -49 A: The parameter b for which the function f(b) is minimal B: -3 this asks for a derivation - but this is not something that should be part of the GRE or is it? Of course this problem could be solved otherwise but I think it still goes beyond the topics that the GRE should cover?",GRE - New quant topics?,1605109478,6,214,1
1,"TLDR: Blindly follow GregMat for AWA. Complete learning vocabulary before practicing any verbal questions. Can't help you much for quant xD. Resources and mock tests given at the end. All the best. :) the title says, I got the scores of the test I'd taken on November 2nd.  give an idea about my background, I am an Indian currently working full-time as a Software Developer and I graduated from my bachelor's in 2019.  My native language is Tamil, but I've been speaking English since I was 6 and I think that I'm as proficient as a native speaker. I'm applying for Computer Science courses with a specialisation in Software Engineering which are ultra-competitive. My GPA is pretty average(7.83/10) so I am hoping that a great GRE score would give me the edge I need to land a decent university. Kinda disappointed that most of my programs are waiving the GRE, but the ones I'm applying to at least consider it, so I'm hoping it will help. format that I'd gotten for the test was VQVQV. I was actually glad it was like this, as my major concern was getting a great(preferably perfect quant score). From my mocks, I was confident that I'd get 160+ in verbal whatever happens, which is more than enough for the programs I am applying for. They mainly look at quant scores.  went pretty well. For both my prompts, I was easily able to identify 3 solid points to argue my position. Verbal went as expected. I am pretty sure that the first verbal section was experimental. The questions were weird, the options were a lot more ambiguous than usual. One of the reading passages was ridiculously long, it took me 8-10 minutes to do the whole thing. It will be interesting to see if GRE implements these kinds of questions in future tests. The next 2 verbal sections were pretty standard.  was a bit disappointed in my quant score. Like in all mock tests, I had no trouble in solving any of the questions. I had slogged for 2 years in high school and had gotten a good score in the JEE, which is the entrance examinations for getting into the top Indian engineering universities. My Bachelor's was also pretty quant heavy. So I knew that I could easily get a perfect quant score in the GRE if I avoided silly mistakes. However, 168 is still great, and should be enough for what I need anyway. Honestly, I am just happy I don't have to give ETS any more money.  for my prep, for AWA, I basically just watched the 2 r/gregmat YouTube videos, and did a practice essay immediately after for each. Apart from that, I religiously wrote the essays for all of my mock tests. Honestly, if you blindly follow GregMat's format and make sure that you have 3 solid points for the body of your essay, you should get 4 in AWA. Also make sure your vocab and grammar is decent. I have no idea what black magic people do to get a perfect 6. verbal, the biggest contributor to my score was just doing vocab for 1-2 months before I started my actual GRE prep. If there is anything to take away from my experience, DO NOT touch a single verbal ETS question before you have completed vocab. I know it is tempting, I've been there. But there's precious few ETS material you can get your hands on. I did all of Magoosh's high frequency GRE words(Google it to get the PDF), and also all of GregMat's vocabulary playlist. I feel that this is more than enough vocabulary, I did not have trouble in vocabulary for 95% of the questions in all mocks and the actual test. With just vocabulary and some minimal practice, I got 160 in verbal for my first mock test. For further preparation, I simply watched GregMat's videos for strategy, and immediately solved practice questions afterwards. Make sure you don't watch his videos like you're watching Netflix. Sit at your desk with a pen and paper and make sure to solve the questions along with the video. You'd be surprised at how little practice you need to get a great verbal score if you do it properly.   quant there wasn't much preparation to do, I was already getting 169 in mocks. I simply solved the entire Manhattan 5lb book(skipped advanced quant), as well as all the ETS quant material(I will mention these in the end), by doing like 30-40 problems a day. If you are struggling with quant strategy, I can't help you much. Maybe look at GregMat's stuff, he was spot on for AWA and Verbal. Or any other service, again, I hesitate to suggest since I didn't use anything.  it took me 45 days for vocab, and another 30-40 days for practice questions. If you are on a tight schedule, you can practice quant alongside vocab, and it should take you a total of 2 months. I could have done this, but I had a lot of time and I was not sure about when I was giving GRE initially. I did my prep alongside a full-time job, and spent 1-2 hours a day. So I think that almost anybody can get a decent GRE score(320+) in 2 months if they utilise the time that they have properly. the best to those still preparing, make sure to focus and 100% utilise the time that you have. Also, the GRE score doesn't matter that much any more, so you should be fine regardless. Don't sweat it.  that I used:** 5lb and ETS Official Guide + 2 supplementary books test scores:** 1 - 10th September - 169Q 160V  Free Test - 10th October - 163Q 164V. I suggest that you avoid this mock. The verbal is nothing like ETS and the quant is just tedious and needlessly difficult. Their scoring algorithm is also off. - 17th October - 167Q 163V. I recommend taking this free test. Their verbal is as close as it gets to ETS. The second quant section is needlessly difficult, but the scoring is more accurate. They also have an experimental section, which is not there in any ETS mock(thanks ETS). Guide 1- 24th October - 170Q 167V. The scoring is too lenient on this one  2 - 26th October - 169Q 162V Guide 2- 31st October - 168Q 165V 3 - 30th October - 169Q 164V 4AWA. Pretty close to the actual GRE.

Usually I always have 9-10 mins in the end to review which I did in the first one and I even corrected one of the mistakes.

When I found the Big Book and watched GregMat’s “Simplification on Steroids” video, I started to feel significantly stronger in Reading Comprehension performance. Not entirely sure what happened on test day, to be honest. Only a few RC questions felt iffy, but noticeably the Analytical Reasoning questions felt much different from any of my practice in the Big Book. I’ll definitely be interested in seeing the Diagnostic Report. felt like an absolute mess on test day after I felt like I had been making gains and seeing decently consistent performance on practice questions and mocks. Lots of very long and dense word problems and several QC’s with two or more constrained variables that required testing several options to arrive at an answer. Fairly certain the second section of Quant was experimental as I didn’t get to five of the questions. On the final section, I definitely ran out of time spending too long on some questions in the middle and ended up forfeiting some questions I probably was totally able to muscle through. I needed a thorough review, so I did the Manhattan Prep Math Strategies book cover to cover and did all ETS Math Review, including questions and Mixed Practice Sets. is extremely mortifying to share publicly, but I lost control of my bladder at the beginning of the first Quant section (I got QVQVQ) and wet myself. Thank god I was at home!! Paralyzed for about two minutes, I definitely lost time in the lead-up trying to hold it back, but then was just aghast in embarrassment and disbelief for a bit. Not sure if that got me a second Quant section that was medium or if I was still able to get hard and then bombed that. Since I couldn’t clean up until the 10 minute break, I was sitting in the wet for the first Verbal section as well which was uncomfortable, definitely distracting. I only drank one glass of water in the morning about two hours beforehand and went to the bathroom immediately before beginning. I’ve taken 7 timed mocks and never had a problem. Honestly baffled about what happened. this said...I’m really wondering what the best plan of attack might be for a retake. I would love to get at least 162 in Verbal, ideally 165, and I just want to get a 160 in Quant. I have the following resources remaining: Power Prep Test 1
-GRE Power Prep Plus Test 3
-GRE 2010 Paper Practice Test Booklet
-Princeton Review Mock
-GRE Big Book Tests 17-27 anyone have any recommendations for how to make this final push?

1,"So I finally took the GRE this past week after a month of prep and had an awful experience. I managed to get a score of Q160 and V160, which is not something I was expecting, considering I was scoring in the 330+ range on my mock tests (PowerPrep and PowerPrep Plus). had a particularly horrendous quant section which shook my confidence in the middle of the exam ; there were some questions there that I had never seen on any GRE prep material and was very much surprised to see. The section had a disproportionate amount of difficult as well as time-consuming questions - math has always been my strong suit, so I know that if I had more time I could have solved even the tough questions, but I simply ran out of time. I felt very disheartened from that point forward and I think this had a negative impact on my performance for the rest of the test.  said, I am considering retaking the GRE again as all the programs I want to apply for want strong quant scores. After reflecting on my test experience, I think my actionable steps are to perfect my timing and get familiar with more advanced math concepts. I also want to ensure that I eliminate the chance of making any silly mistakes. I already completed a small portion of Manhattan 5lb this time around, but other than doing this more diligently, what other quant resources should I look into?  are there any other test prep tips I should keep in mind to score higher the next time around? help and guidance is appreciated, thanks!",Advice after taking the GRE - should I retake?,1603722108,10,295,1
1,"When I got my unofficial scores right after the test it was hard to believe the score but official ones came in today (Test taken 10/17). It would normally be a good score, but I am not sure if it's good enough to get into some of the competitive graduate schools that I'm interested in. Also, my practice tests showed that I should have done way better. Here is a breakdown of my general studying/tests.  over the summer from early July to late August until college courses started again. Took a break from studying then started up again about a month before the test. I used Official ETS Verbal, Official ETS Guide, GregMat &amp; Manhattan 5 lb. Here are my practice test scores.

1,"Hey folks! got done with the GRE at home about an hour ago, and wanted to make a helpful post which might benefit similar people. Non-native speaker, undergraduate in CS, graduated in 2018 and working a rather demanding job. My Maths skills are fairly decent, and I used to be a voracious reader in school so I wasn't too worried about either section. I'm targeting CS programs so wanted a good score in Quant, and something not too embarrassing in Verbal. Used**: Manhattan 5lbs and ETS official material ETS official material Magoosh Basic and Common Words ONLY I prepared for \~4 months on and off, there were weeks where I would study 2 hours a day, and there would be gaps wherein I'd get no studying done for about 2-3 weeks. (Avoid this as much as possible, it made me feel like I was starting from scratch every time I picked things back up, especially vocab). I guess my overall prep time counting breaks would be 2 months. loathed learning vocab, and it wasn't uncommon to find me silently cursing ETS more and memorizing words less. I could only do about \~650 words, which is quite honestly enough to get something in the area of 158-162 in Verbal. also watched Gregmat's verbal and quantitative strategy videos, the AWA tasks videos, (and since I have Gregmat+) some of his verbal classes . The man is a saviour for me in Verbal, and I may die but will never forget all The Office scenes in his videos! They brought sunlight to my otherwise dark, tiring days.  I didn't end up applying some strategies suggested by Gregmat, watching his Verbal videos was eye-opening for me as they made me think about and approach verbal in a very logical way. also maintained a error log of my mistakes, which is filled with good stuff like ""Read the word problem properly idiot!""/""Please find evidence of you answer choice for Verbal questions, don't assume!"" and so on. Tests** 169Q, 157V 164Q, 161V, 5.0 AWA (I screwed up Quant big time here due to a shit ton of stupidity, which thankfully I didn't repeat on the final day) Employed**  Issue Task (format pretty much the same as Gregmat's): 1 introduction paragraph, 3 paragraphs supporting your  position, 1 describing a counter and countering that counter, conclusion
2. Argument Task: 1 introductory paragraph, 3 paragraphs, each examining one assumption in detail, Conclusion (Give more evidence blah blah, don't do research in a stupid manner blah blah) also generously used semicolons wherever appropriate cuz why not. Start with SE, then TC, then for RC go from small passages to long passages
2. My vocab wasn't great so pairing strategy wasn't the best idea for me honestly, what I instead did was read the sentence, figure out the blank, then look for appropriate answer choices.
3. For TC, what works best is guessing the blanks, and then looking at the answer choices from E-A.
4. For RCs and CR passages, the ""simplifying sentences"" strategy works really well. Greg also has some videos talking about how to figure out the function of each sentence, which would be helpful here. Start with the question immediately after all QCs (8th/9th), solve till 20 and go back to Q1.
2. If you're not able to figure out the answer in a minute or so, mark the question for review, pick one random choice and move on.
3. An error log really helps here, since one of the most common mistakes I used to make during practice was not accounting for fractional values while solving QCs. home testing experience was perfect, the proctors changed thrice but I was able to get their attention via chat whenever I needed. in all, I'm so happy that I finally don't have to see ETS' GRE material ever again!  this sub has been incredibly helpful during my prep, DM me/comment below with questions if you have any and I'll try to answer most of them!

1,"Just finished with my GRE today! The proctor experience went quite smooth. I was lucky to have no power cuts or any other interruptions!  got QVQVQ thankfully as I am better at math. But the last Q section was definitely experimental. The complexity as well as the length of questions, both were too high. I consider my math to be pretty decent and had at least 5-7 mins on previous Quant sections left for revision. But in this section I was hardly able to even attempt all the questions and guessed on about 3-4. Overall, was pretty thrilled when I saw my scores!

Followed GregMat's 1 Month Plan to a T, 3-4 hours/day. This plan was a godsend and I have no idea how I would've structured my studying without it. used official GRE Prep material + Manhattan 5 LB to get the hang of quant formulas.  vocab, I first went through Magoosh, GregMat, and Vince's GRE lists to find words I didn't know, then put them in a Quizlet.

GRE Guide P2- 165V/167Q Day:
Got to the testing center 30 minutes before start time, had drank a grande coffee before to keep myself alert + a huge breakfast to make sure my energy levels would stay high. Made sure to bring snacks and water, which we were instructed to leave on a table outside the testing room. 
Test was QVQVQ, which was a relief since I was too tired to tackle 3 sections of verbal and critical thinking. The scored sections were nothing out of the ordinary, some questions were tricky but manageable with some logic. The 10-minute break went smoothly, I went to the bathroom and did some light stretching before going back in. 
The experimental Quant, on the other hand, was a disaster. I couldn't even read through a few of the problems and guessed on over half of the questions. I had a feeling this was the experimental because the problems were so convulted and just felt out of place. I think it's pretty easy to tell what's experimental with quant, the problems are on another level of difficulty and complexity.
GRE likes to throw details into answers that are easy to miss, but can be identified once you've seen enough. A passage discussing computer programming, for instance, may have an answer that discusses computer ""mechanics"" or another related word. Chances are if an answer is too specific, it's wrong (at least from my experience).  the multiple-choice Quant questions, your best bet is to plug in the answer choices to see what works. GregMat had a great video on this trick.  the daily newspaper right before going into the exam, since for the AWA they'll be helpful to pull examples for the first essay! studied a total of 750 words and still didn't recognize some vocab, so focus on expanding your strategies AND vocabulary for the Verbal.

1,"I posted in this very subreddit just after giving the **GRE** about how devastated I was after scoring not up to my expectation. I wanted to give it another go. But, I was elated by seeing some of my schools waiving GRE and getting a 4 on AWA. Maybe, a 4 on AWA (55th percentile) is pretty mediocre for most of the people, but I had to go all out to score this.  started my preparation in May. At first, I had given ***PP1(300)*** where I got a terrible verbal score. After that, I was reading on and off without any prior schedule. Two months ago, I decided to get my shit back together, and started to read regularly.  And also I started to do full length practice tests on every other weekends. first, verbal was arcane to me, but after time (watching a heck lot of **GregMat's** videos), I started to see patterns in the questions. As Quant was always my stronger suit, I was fairly confident in it with respect to verbal. With time, I saw my scores rising from the horrible initial score. I kind of plateaued in the 315-318 region for  two-three weeks. Then I pushed my daily routine to more hours than usual. Finally, my scores were in above 320 range. I begin to have confidence which was shattered today.  It took me almost 4-5 months to get from 301 to 320+ range. The test is a tough one, I must admit. to the present, in all my practice tests, I had at least **5-12** minutes after solving the whole Quant Section, whereas, in the real test I was running out of time , and I knew that I was not able to solve all of them because some of them (5-6) had long calculations. This tedious Quant problems really differed from the free Powerprep ones, and threw me off. I have no problems in verbal, the verbal sections represented the same difficulties as the ETS mocks.

PP2 : 315 ( Q - 158 , V -157) not trust PP tests scoring. They are just going to help you simulate test conditions and help you familiarize with the test interface.  general tips :
1. Different prep materials from different companies is just a way to solve more and more questions. They do not mimic GRE questions.
2. Do not rely too much on mock test scores. Even PPs, they aren't always a good indicator of what you're going to get in the actual GRE.
3. Never take a lot of pressure on test day. I'm someone who shits before every test but I had conditioned my mind to be calm on test day and it helped.
4. Quants section in actual GRE is a bit unpredictable. You can get a relatively easier section and the next day someone might get a difficult section.
5. If you do well on the first section of verbal there's a huge chance of getting a hefty bonus. I scored 16/20 in my first verbal section and 8/20 in the second section (it was hard af). I got 24/40 correct but got 159 so +5 bonus in Verbal just because my first section went really good.

1,"TL; DR summarised tips : GregMat should be your go-to channel for everything. Purchasing GregMat+ was the best decision I made for my GRE prep. Totally worth it! PP's are very important, and you should give them in a similar environment as you would on test day The GRE is really not that tough, but most people make silly mistakes because of pressure. Remain calm, and believe in yourself. Be honest with yourself and know when to leave a question and move ahead to the next one. 
 amazing people or r/GRE. I have been reading posts on this subreddit since I started preparing for my GRE, and it's been a great experience. The courses I am applying to focus mostly on quants, so here's how I studied a lil background, I'm not a native English speaker. But I have studied a lot of Maths (did my UG in Computer Science). So I had to put a lot of effort in verbal.  started off with the Magoosh flashcards. The basic and easy ones are more than enough. Next I picked up the ETS VR guide and familiarised myself with the TC, SE and RC questions. I followed u/gregmat 's advice to the T , and avoided all 3rd party material for VR.  quants I basically revised the concepts from the ETS QR guide and solved the Manhattan 5 lb book, doing one chapter a day. Gave my first mock test (PP1) and scored 157 V and 153 Q.  the week before my test I tested positive for coronavirus and had to reschedule my exam, and take a 2 week break in studying. Because of this break I had lost all momentum, and then tore a muscle in my shoulder while doing some work. Again, I had to take a 1 week break.  I was freaked out because after my break it was like I'm back to square one, and I had just 1 week for my GRE. So I binged on GregMat's videos like a Netflix series, did some vocab everyday and basically just kept myself calm. One day before my test I gave PP2 and scored 156 V and 158 Q.  my test day I got the sections as VQVQV , and my second quants section was really, extremely tough. I barely had enough time to finish it. But I kept myself calm, and got a pretty decent score.  took 2 weeks to prepare for the GRE before I got sick, and then 1 week once I recovered so, I'm pretty happy with my scores. the best to anyone appearing for the exam anytime soon, you got this!!","So I gave my GRE today - 160 V, 165 Q",1602872113,12,495,1
1,"Hi all,   
I've been surfing this sub for a while, and was a little reticent to post my scores since I received them because of all the absurdly high numbers on here...but then if those who don't score as high refuse to post, those in the same boat wouldn't know that their scores are (obviously, statistically speaking) normal as well.  scored 162V and 154Q; I took the test at the end of September.  I've always had issues with math, my main issues being little mistakes, such as flipping a sign when I write it down or switching two numbers (this has been a problem most of my life, so it was not new to me).  I've also never been a standardized test taker; I've always felt that the format of these exams were not the best evaluation tool for one's intellect or capabilities, but I digress.  studied from June-September, at first utilizing the Magoosh study plan, supplemented with both Manhattan 5-lb book and gregmat vocab.  I will say that my first few weeks studying with Magoosh were extremely dedicated; I believe they indicated most students only work with alacrity and dedication for about 6 weeks, and I would probably agree with that assessment, as my most dedicated studying took place during that time.  I also work a full-time job, which made the crazy studying hours more challenging.  I would suggest that it may be a good idea to shorten the prep time a bit to fit within, or just after this window (6 weeks or so).  I do think that some of the math was harder to maintain from when I first went through the concept videos until I took the test; I found myself having to rewatch some videos towards the end.  enjoy reading and writing, so those sections were easier for me.  I do think the biggest challenges are the RCs. I didn't really study for the AWA; I did a few practice prompts and generally followed guidelines of basic argument/essays.  As for the math, I think the best strategy is time management, as this was a big obstacle for me-- I believe that it hurt me in the end, as I didn't have enough time to answer some of the questions, and I was kicking myself because some of the questions I didn't answer, I could have if I had skipped the more complex questions.  So work on your time management as much as possible.  know that it is hard to remember it is just a test, especially when you believe your entire future depends on the results of this exam written by individuals whose sole purpose is to create another financial barrier for individuals attempting to get into graduate school, trust me.  However it is *just a test*.  Did I perform in the math section as well as I'd hoped? Hell no. But I'm happy enough with my score that I do not think I will retake it right now.   
 of luck on your exams!  Breathe easy and remember you aren't alone!

1,"i personally found these types of posts on this sub to be quite helpful when i was studying for the GRE, so i wanted to write one of my own. i took the test on 10/7, and studied a total of 120 hours over the past few months. i got QVQVQ, and i suspect that the 2nd quant section was experimental. i received the official scores this morning (10/15) and i'm very pleased with the results. will try my best to answer if you have a question! experience:** it went smoothly for the most part. i was definitely scared by the amount of proctoru horror stories i read. the proctors sometimes took a while to respond, but it didn't affect my testing experience overall. i just wanted to put this out here to balance out the negative experiences that people talk a lot about. of course, shoutout to u/gregmat for his essay templates. in the 2-3 weeks leading up to the exam, i wrote practice essays almost everyday. i tended to have trouble with the issue essay in comparison to the argument essay, so i doubled the amount of practice i did for that. i used prompts from the official ETS website, and that definitely paid off - the issue essay prompt i was given was one of the ones i had practiced.   
[ seen some people recommend coming up with examples for every single prompt in the pool, but this seems way too time-consuming. a lot of the prompts are similar, so just familiarize yourself with the types of prompts and have some go-to examples. for instance, i wrote a lot about donald trump in my practice essays, because he fits the mold for a lot of the prompts about power, politics, and leadership. i am a native speaker of english, so i acknowledge that this alone was a huge advantage. for reading comp big book is the most helpful tool. i did 2+ verbal sections every day (skipping the question types that weren't relevant to the current test) and that helped me get a good feel for how ETS phrases what they ask and what they tend to focus on. for sentence equivalence, i used gregmat's pairing strategy all the time.  text completion and strengthening my vocab, i did some of the things that a lot of people recommend on this sub, like reading the new york times and the atlantic. however, i did not keep a dedicated word list nor did i use any vocab apps.  this is what i found to be the most helpful: i have a habit of re-reading books and articles that i've enjoyed over and over, usually several times in a year. a lot of the content i was reading had tons of GRE-level vocab within it, and so i was able to recognize words that i'd seen. even if i didn't know the exact definition, i could hazard a pretty good guess because i would remember the context it appeared in. i know this isn't really for everyone, but it helped me a lot during the test for at least 4-5 questions. a lot of my studying was revisiting concepts i'd learned before in high school. big book quant was ok for this, but the best was definitely manhattan 5 lb. i kept an error log and drilled my weaknesses with manhattan. for both verbal and quant, i only looked at ETS material in the week leading up to the test so that i would be in the right mindset. struggled a lot with timing leading up to and during the exam. if i had unlimited time on every section, i am confident that i could solve any problem correctly. however, this is most definitely not the case, and i had to coach myself to skip tricky questions and go back to them later instead of doggedly going at it. i recommend using a timer when practicing quant sections. i sometimes set the timer for less time than i would be allotted on the real exam, just to up the pressure.  lot of people have noted that quant was harder on the actual GRE than the practice exams. in my personal experience, it was about the same as powerprep plus. i was emotionally prepared for the quant to be more difficult, but this thankfully wasn't the case. exams:** i used one official exam for diagnostic purposes after my first few weeks of studying (i don't think taking one before studying is particularly useful.) then, i used the rest in the month or so leading up to test day, doing one full-length exam once a week. i did practice exams on the same day of week and time as the actual exam. i recommend taking non-ETS tests only to practice your test-taking stamina. don't get too caught up on the score. the practice tests that were paper-based/PDF-based, i used excel spreadsheets to recreate the actual testing experience, entering my answers in electronically and using a whiteboard for my work. this was helpful in getting accustomed to erasing my work and using my laptop at the same time. practice exam scores were as follows - official guide test 1 - 168V, 158Q

 it’s kinda funny because I was very confident on the essays but not the rest of the test, and I did much better on that than the essays. Overall these scores will be a definite boost to my application since I’m applying as an out of field student. Since this sub helped me organize materials and a study plan, here’s what I did: months of studying, with the last 2 weeks more on refining concepts and vocab I was unfamiliar with. 
 parrot 95% of the testing experience posts here, USE GREGMAT+. The last true math I took was a statistics course in 2016 and 2 business math courses in 2017. Never took trig or calc. It has always been a weak side to my academia and I remembered very little from high school. I ran through the arithmetic &amp; algebra lectures and did all the homework he assigned in them in roughly the first 3 weeks at about 1 video a day. I used some practice problems from manhattan and the 5lb book but a majority of it was just nailing the fundamental concepts and learning how to use the test to my advantage via back solving and testing variables. Also did the coordinate geometry lecture the week before as a refresher.
  english speaker so I understand that’s an innate advantage here. I also wrote an (unpublished) novel in my senior year of high school so I felt I had a strong grasp on many words and grammatical concepts already. Still, I was only getting mid 150s before watching the gregmat lectures. They teach you how to critically think about the questions and structures rather than what just sounds good to the ear. Same with the reading, it’s good to use the logical strategies he outlines rather than trying to pick it apart without a plan.  strongly recommend the magoosh vocab app (but don’t bother past the intermediate levels) and another app called vocab builder by Entrayn Educational Technology. In addition to this I made a print out of barron’s vocab list and drilled that along with writing another 800 word and studying that for the 2 months. It really helped me to learn words in synonym bunches and assign definitions that way than to do individual words all the time as well. Here’s a link to the printout: 
 that, I used a google drive folder with many practice problems and notes in it. Here’s a link to that:  
 just watched the two gregmat videos on youtube and memorized a few examples for each argument category. I wish I could provide more advice here but I didn’t tackle it until the weekend prior.
 luck everyone, and remember it’s just a test, it doesn’t have to define anything about you beyond your ability to know how to take it!",164V 161Q 4.5 AWA - beyond expectations,1602784875,7,611,1

So I thought I should pass it forward :) gave the test on the 30th of September, started seriously prepping around mid-August I think. The courses I'm applying to only care about quant so I didn't study for verbal at all.  what my scores looked like: 1 (30/08/2020) - 164V, 162Q (a lot of silly mistakes) 1 (9/09/2020) - 160V, 158Q (harder than powerprep, threw me off) 2 (12/09/2020) - 162V, 160Q 3 (16/09/2020) - 160V, 162Q 2 (20/09/2020) - 166V, 164Q (some more silly mistakes) Plus (29/09/2020) - 167V, 164Q (MUCH harder than powerprep i thought) a lot of people mention here, the actual test was significantly harder than both Powerpreps. It was probably similar or just a little bit easier than Powerprep plus. Also, like a lot of people mention, Manhattan is very useful for timing strategies and to just get used to general test-taking. I'm not a good test taker and Manhattan really helped with that, but it's not very good for assessing weaknesses! For instance,  Manhattan DI was way more complex than what ETS gives. to other people on the silly mistakes brigade, in the last 10 days, I did a lot of practice from the big book, and I think I eventually did get much better at reading questions correctly, copying numbers correctly, not doing 3+2 = 6, etc!  this is useful, all the best to everyone :)","Final scores in - 160 V, 166 Q!",1602769723,10,322,1

1,"I gave my GRE test on 3rd Oct at a nearby testing centre. A major reason behind choosing a test centre rather than home based test was the unreliable internet connectivity at my place. The centre was well maintained. There were not many students at the time of the test, hence there were not many distractions. The invigilators were cooperative.  my prep:  did most of the prep in a 1.5-2 month period just before the test. I had a Magoosh 6 month subscription which I had purchased about 1.5 years before the exam. I had kept it frozen for most of the time. Although, Magoosh team extended my subscription for free when I mentioned my concerns.  solved all the practice questions in the Magoosh prep (about 1200 good quality questions). For vocabulary I used their flashcard app and learnt about 450 words from it. Other than Magoosh, I used Manhattan 5Lb book to practice weak topics in Maths and used the Offical GRE guide for making myself comfortable with actual test questions.  writing, I kept a Word file in which I used to collect all my practice essays. I always practiced them in a timed manner. I chose essay questions from different topics, ranging from education and technology to arts and government. In the end, I distributed the collected essays in separate files and emailed them to my friends who were already done with their GRE test. They graded my essays critically and even mentioned some common mistakes that I make.  the actual test, I gave 8 full length tests from different sources including Magoosh, Manhattan Prep, Kaplan and Princeton Review. I kept an excel sheet in which I noted all the practice test scores with remarks. The average score of all the practice tests was about 320 with 165+ in Q and about 155 in V. The highest score was in PP2 which was 326. I had expected a score about 320 on the actual test, but to my surprise I score better than that.  imp things to keep in mind:  sequence in which you get your sections affects your performance and mental state. For example, if a person finds Verbal difficult, then a VVQQV or VQVQV sequence would be tiring and demotivating. So make sure that you practice enough number of tests to encounter all sorts of section sequences and improve your endurance.  Review offers essay grading, so use that free test wisely after substantial practice of AWA section.  hope this helps anyone who is taking the GRE in the upcoming days.",Final GRE Score Q170 V159 AWA5.0,1602735195,6,466,1

I was working full-time and studied for a couple of hours every evening (I missed several days in between). I am incredibly happy with my score. Oddly, my actual score is better than the scores I got on my practice exams! A day before the test I took PPP2 and scored 157V 161Q 4.5AW.

The proctors followed the CDC guidelines, the test-takers sat 6 feet apart, and we were required to wear masks throughout the exam.

1,"Hey guys, I took the GREs last week and I just got my score back: 165V/169Q/5AW. benefited a lot from lurking around here and thought I'd share my own study experience and strategies, which was a lot more relaxed than a lot of others' on this sub but, in my opinion, way more effective. total, I spent 40 hours preparing for the GRE, leisurely spread out over a span of 2 months. I think this was a perfect amount of time, considering how I was also balancing school and part-time jobs. I imagine there are others in my position too where it's just unfeasible to spend 4 hours a day for 2 months grinding for the GRE. A lot of the advice I came across was basically that you have to spend a lot of time practicing or else you're screwed! It's true that you can game the GRE if you practice enough, but it's also inefficient and not realistic to spend that much time and effort on it.  was my study schedule: [ broke up my preparation into 3 phases: familiarization, practice, and review. I also used Notion and Toggl to track my study time and record my study sessions. I spent the bare minimum on test prep (basically only paid for the GRE test) -- you can find most GRE prep books (ETS, Manhattan, Kaplan) on libgen, and tools like Quizlet are free.  In this stage, I focused on getting a sense of the GRE and the content tested. This was to prepare me for a diagnostic test so that I could identify the gaps in my knowledge and spend the next stage building up those weak areas.  I read through the ETS math review and watched a couple of Khan Academy videos on quant topics that I wasn't certain about.
* I browsed through the entire list of issue and argument topics, and watched Gregmat's videos about how to formulate responses. I also looked at other people's sample responses online (just from Googling, obviously not all were good) and would think about how I'd improve on their response.
* I also created this [prompt generator]( on Google Sheets and would use that to give myself writing prompts to brainstorm.
* I started doing Magoosh vocab flashcards, but eventually switched to creating my own set on Quizlet.  I started by doing one of the ETS paper tests as a diagnostic to identify where I would have to spend more time improving.  I worked through the ETS quant practices and recorded every single mistake I made along with an explanation of what I did wrong and what the right answer was in a Google Doc. This was really helpful in identifying my weak topics and that I often made careless mistakes by reading the questions too quickly.
* I wrote a couple of essays before I figured out what really worked for me. I also did some practice brainstorming sessions: get a prompt and write down an outline in 5-10 minutes. 
* I did the verbal practice questions in the ETS book and would add every single word I didn't know to my Quizlet flashcards set. 
* I'd also add words I came across in daily life (e.g. reading the news) to my Quizlet set. 
* After reviewing my mistake list, I did practices in the respective topics in the Manhattan 5lb book. 
* I did official tests once a week, and did all 4 free tests. I found it important to take these tests as if you would in exam conditions: no breaks between, and for an extra level of difficulty, at the end of a long day.  I looked through my quant mistakes sheet and went through my flashcard set, and reviewed my writing responses. For the tests, I would make sure I understood why I made the mistakes I did and would make a mental note of those things before I began each new test.  this was my score progression:

 conclusion, I think there's definitely such a thing as being over-prepared for the GRE and burning yourself out.

1,"Hello! I first took the GRE at a testing facility on 09/21, and while my scores weren't abysmal, I was disappointed given that my Quant score isn't ideal for the programs I'm applying for. The following are the results of my practice tests prior to the test.  PP1:  Verbal - 157, Quant - 164
* PP2:  Verbal - 158, Quant - 161 
* PPPlus 1:  Verbal - 159, Quant - 160, AW - 5.0  these three mock tests, it was finally time for my actual test, where I received the following scores.  Actual GRE:  Verbal - 159, Quant - 160, AW - 5.0 decided to retake the test and am scheduled for the at-home version on 11/15, so I have roughly 4 weeks to prepare. Today I took the free Manhattan Prep test and received the following score.  Manhattan:  Verbal - 160, Quant - 159.  a clear pattern among all my scores:  both my Verbal and Quant scores have little variance and hover right at the 160 mark. I'm aiming for 165 or above on the Quant section, and I'm not too worried for Verbal and AW as I'm a native English speaker and writing has always been a favorite of mine.  noticed my biggest weakness for Quant is time management. For example, in all my tests, I ace the first Quant section, only to then struggle in the harder second section where I run out of time. I'm subscribed to GregMat+ and I have employed his Quant strategies, e.g. Choosing Numbers, Back-solving, B-D method, in all my tests. But again, my weakness is time management.  have about 4 weeks left until I retake the test, and I average roughly 3 hours of study per day, which I feel is adequate. I usually study both Verbal and Quant each study session, but I'm pondering whether I should abandon that study plan and instead focus solely on Quant so as to improve my time management skills in that area. Any advice on how to move forward?",Guidance on Improving Time Management for Quant?,1602629295,8,389,1

1,"Hi, I'm a non native speaker. I appeared for the general test on 3rd October. The pattern on that day was QVQVQ. The middle section of quant was most probably experimental or research section. But it was really nerve wrecking and time consuming. I guessed on a few questions in that section and questions were really weird as compared to normal quant sections I'd encountered till then. 
Overall, my testing experience was smooth. Both the PowerPrep practice tests really helped and one of the most things is to analyse your mistakes. Gregmat+ is a godsend, truly. Greg's verbal strategies really helped me in improving my verbal score. I would definitely recommend learning vocabulary by either watching Gregmat's vocab videos on his website or better read newspapers and articles. For the last two months my most visited site would Google's dictionary. I started watching Schitt's Creek after the test but that show has a ton of GRE words. Don't be lethargic to find the meaning of any word you don't know the meaning of and also don't depend on rote learning. That is an inefficient and boring way of learning vocab. 
For AWA, I followed Greg's format as it helps streamline things and provides clarity. I would suggest to practice writing few essays as it helps in managing the time. 30 minutes passes a lot faster when you've to write an essay. 
For Quant, I solved questions from the Manhattan 5 lb book. But I would like to mention that I wasn't really struggling in quant.  Q166, V157

0,"I'm too lazy to scan it and upload a pic, but I got a 760 today. Q50 V42 IR6. This is going to be filled with a bunch of grammatical mistakes cause my brain is fried. I started my GMAT journey around July and have studied pretty much every day since then. I took my first exam official mock in July and scored a 530. I was really discouraged because I wasn't as good at math/reading as I thought I was.  After I got over my sadness, I got to work. I first bought the MGMAT books that came with the 6 CATS and the 2022 official guide. I worked through the MGMAT and took my first practice test(Kaplan free test), which wasn't great: 630. After that, I realized that I was still struggling with some quant topics, so I knew I needed to change something. That's when I found TTP. isn't an ad. I'm not getting paid. I just want to be completely honest and save you guys time and money. TTP is 100% the best GMAT prep. It takes forever to complete. I didn't even finish it before I took my exam. I only completed the quant and sentence correction sections. It is so comprehensive and lengthy; but it is well worth it. I truly believe anyone can get a 700+ if he/she completes TTP and reviews the material regularly. I had several hundred flash cards that I reviewed daily by the time I got to my test date. I took 4 practice exams in total. 530 -&gt; 630 kaplan -&gt; 640 MGMAT 1 -&gt; 740 official practice test #3. Take as many as you can afford on the mba website. It's important to get your timing down. advice is to just stay focused and determined. I have never been amazing at standardized testing or school, but I did really well. I think I got like a 1390/1600 on the SAT in high school and was like top 50% of my class lol. I know it's expensive but TTP is definitely the best resource for GMAT prep. If you are having trouble paying for prep material, shoot me a dm. I have the 2022 GMAT official guide, Manhattan advanced quant (untouched), MGMAT ALL THE GMAT books, and Manhattan strategy books.

Scored over 85% on global test and in my 6 official mocks, my lowest Q was 42 and highest was 48 but I ended up with a Q35 on the official?!???   wanted to try TTP verbal but honestly I was exhausted from the quant material. It was just soooooo much. I used gmat ninja on YT and Manhattan free prep hour. I also watched the twitch the gmat verbal. Honestly I don’t think I did the right thing and it was evident because the highest verbal in my mocks was V28 and on the official, I got a V27. For the life of me I can’t seem to understand CR and because I spend so much time on it, I lose valuable RC time.

0,"I took my GMAT yesterday and I was overwhelmingly thrilled to get a 720. I thought I would share my GMAT journey for two reasons: 1-  To give some hope and guidance to those struggling to get their scores up and 2-  To give myself a much earned pat on the shoulder after 3 months of studying.  thing to note is that English is actually my third language after Arabic and French, and I only started learning English when I was 8 years old. As you will see in this post, language is not my strongest asset and that did certainly reflect with a poor starting point on verbal with a V28. My target score was therefore around 660+, and I would have been more than thrilled with a 680.  June: took my first mock test, scored 580 (Q40, V28). Given my poor verbal performance, I decided to purchase Manhattan. I found the Quant and SC sections to be very helpful, especially a few strategies in Quant that really just put you on the Q48+ level.  finishing my Manhattan review, I took a Manhattan CAT in which I scored a 620. Realizing that Manhattan CATs are generally more difficult than the real thing, I didn't let the poor score dishearten me. I went on to practice questions from the official guide, and took my second official exam around mid-July. Scoring 640 (Q48, V30) on my second official practice test was such a disappointment that I actually needed a break from studying to reassess my  strategies. I took a month break and restarted studying around mid-August. In the past few months, I did the following: I reset my Official Guide questions and repeated the questions again. I reviewed my summary sheet from Manhattan prep. I kept an error log on all the idioms, formulas and strategies that I had missed the first time.  I reset the official guide and took the Medium and Hard questions AGAIN. I took all the free practice tests online ( Veritas, Princeton, Kaplan ) and the remaining 5 MGMAT practice tests within 2-3 weeks. This really helped practice my pace, my SC pace got much better and I was able to spend more time on CR and RC questions. I was scoring in the 650 to 670 range on these exams.  On my last week, I reviewed my error log and summary again. Took the exam on the weekend and scored my highest ever scores in both sections (Q49,V38). takeaways:  Practice practice practice. That was a real game changer for me. Don't be discouraged by a few low scores. It's just part of the process. Repeat questions you didn't get right the first time after a while. I found that in many instances I would do the same mistake again, although I had read and understood the solutions before. Finally, don't ignore IR and AWA for too long. Despite having exceeded my personal target and expectations on verbal quant, I was still disappointed with a very low IR score.  During the exam, I focused a lot on the first 10 questions in Verbal to make sure I got them right.  This sub has a lot of amazing people who have encouraged me throughout the way. Use it!

0,"Hey everyone,  
 -  Male, Graduated in a healthcare field ( Medicine, Dental, Nursing etc ) 3 years ago. I joined my family business right after graduating because I figured that my degree will not help me achieve the financial success that I want and also that it wasn't something that I was interested in.  I always wanted to an MBA but after much research, I concluded that I need some business experience before I  pursue an MBA.  
A few months ago I decided that it is time to pursue an MBA and gain the neccessary skills and move into the corporate world. have not studied mathematics since after the 10th grade, although I did study physics in 10th and 12th grade. I was excellent in physics and mathematics, although I can't say how good I would be in Mathematics that is taught beyond the 10th grade. I am mentioning this because the time I took in completing TTP might be lesser than normally required, so take that time with a grain of salt.

  
I started my GMAT prep in the last week of July. I initially started with Manhattan math fundamentals book, read the first 100 pages or so, but still felt lost on how to cover everything. Researching on googe, GMATClub and reddit led me to TTP ( Mostly Reddit ). I was hesistant at first because at times it feels like a shill army is promoting TTP but 1$ trial was there, so I figured WTH. I will only lose 1$. I bought the trial ( 5 days ), found that the course was nicely structured, covered almost everything ( no RC yet ) and was so vast that it there was nothing to be missed ( Acc. to all the good AND bad reviews ).  
 bought the 1 month package on 2nd August. The next 15 days were not optimal. Because of a family reunion of sorts, I couldn't study more than an hour per day on average. Then from 17th I started preparing seriously. I spent around 228 hours on TTP and around 50 hours or so on OG. I stopped tracking 10 days ago but that estimate is pretty close.  
I finished OG and OG quant Review. I did not get time to do OG Verbal Review. 

  
TTP analytics - I was almost always above their recommended accuracy percentages, in a few chapter the accuracy did dip below the accuracy levels recommended. Overall accuracy - Quant - 88%, Verbal - 84%.  
 accuracy - Quant - 95%, Verbal \~85%.  
 Tests -  1 - 15.2.21 - 660. 2 - 5.10.21 - 700 ( Screwed up because I was sleep and energy deprived. )

 3 - 9.10.21 - 730 (Q-49, V-40, IR-8) 4 - 12.10.21 - 760 (Q-51, V-41, IR-4)(Could not wrap my head around a few IR questions)  
 GMAT - 750 (Q-49, V-42, IR-8)( Messed up quant a bit because the scratch pad had 2-3 fewer pages, screwed my timing). might give GMAT in the future if this score is not enough for my application.

0,"Hi everyone,
I started my GMAT research a while back by looking at some of the posts on this subreddit. There were a lot of useful tips on here and now I wanted to add my own experience to maybe help some of you who are currently preparing for the GMAT.
I am currently in an german undergraduate business administration programme and about 1 year away from graduating. My plan is to continue with a masters programme, preferably a Masters in Finance. I knew that most of the top business schools would require the GMAT so I decided to get it done with now. This would also help me to better evaluate at which schools I had a realistic chance of acceptance. 
During my undergraduate programme I never had many problems with quantitative subjects. I am also among the top 1-2% in my undergraduate programme , so I probably had a good starting point in terms of learning ability and ability to comprehend new skills.
I first registered for the actual exam. There were exactly 8 weeks until the exam day and I would be able to study fulltime as I currently had summer break at uni. of Prep:
I bought the OG book bundle and all six practice test and spent about 1-2 hours reading through the general exam info in the OG book. I then did my first practice exam (I would advise everyone to do this right at the beginning of your prep) and actually did pretty well.
Practice Exam #1: 660 (Q45/V35) 1 to 4:
After reading a lot of the posts on this subreddit I figured that TTP should be a good way to study as it included Quant and Verbal (except for RC) and is apparently well received. So that’s pretty much what I did for the next month. I worked through the lessons and did every single practice question (TTP Review at the end). I also finished the SC part of TTP. 5:
I was half way through my prep so I did the second practice exam.
Practice Exam #2: 780 (Q50/V48)
Well that was a nice surprise! I couldn’t believe it, especially as I hadn’t even touched the geometry lessons of TTP yet and guessed every single geometry question.
I then continued following the TTP plan (more quant lessons and starting with CR lessons). I also did 10-15 SC questions from the OG every day to keep my skills in this area. 6:
I did my third practice exam and continued working through the TTP plan.
Practice Exam #3: 770 (Q50/V45) 7:
I finished the TTP course and started doing OG Questions (Quant and Verbal). I finished the OG Book and started doing the questions from the Verbal and Quant Review. I also did my fourth practice exam
Practice Exam #4: 780 (Q51/V47) 8:
I finished the Verbal and Quant Review and almost finished the OG Advanced Questions book. I then did my last practice exam about 7 days before the exam day.
Practice Exam #5: 770 (Q50/V45) Day:
I did only a light session of reviewing questions I did wrong in the days prior and some additional hard questions the day prior. On exam day I got up early and drove to the test center (with plenty of spare time, so I wouldn’t get stressed). When I arrived I did some warmup questions in my car and then walked to the test center. The administrators were really nice and the exam went smoothly.
GMAT EXAM RESULTS: [760]( (Q51/V42)
Quant went really well, I only had to guess one geometry questions. Verbal felt a bit harder and there were several questions I wasn’t sure about (as you can see in my verbal score which was slightly lower than in the practice exams).
Overall I was really happy with my result, as I anticipated a slight drop in my score due to nervousness and the unusual environment of the test center (when compared to my study spot at home). Review:
I really liked the way the TTP course was structured, as it provided you with a nice study plan that you just needed to follow. I can’t tell you if TTP is THE best course out there (as I didn’t do any other courses), but it’s certainly a very good course. 
The Quant lessons and practice questions were awesome. 
I also enjoyed the SC section. The SC lessons were really thorough and in depth (maybe in parts even too in depth), and they will give you a really solid grammar foundation.
The CR lessons were alright. If you are short on time you can probably skip most of the lessons, but make sure to at least go through the first lessons of every topic. That way you will still learn the basics (what is an assumption? etc.). Helpful Tips:
-	Make sure to first get a solid foundation (e.g. by doing a course or reading some Manhattan books etc.) and then tackle the OG questions.
-	TTP will take you longer than you think it will!!! I finished the complete course (on the Expert+ Track) after about 250h, but I am probably on the faster side in terms of study speed.
-	I didn’t do any specific RC lessons but just did the OG questions. I already had a solid foundation as I read a lot of englisch books. Reading books and/or articles will strengthen your RC skills, but it will take some time, so start now!
-	There are awesome SC explanations on GMATClub. After you answered some OG SC questions I advise you to go there and read the experts explanations of the question and answer choices (Shoutout to GMATNinja, daagh, and EmpowerGMATVerbal)
-	I didn’t do any specific prep for IR, as I scored an 8 in every practice exam. IR will automatically increase if you study for Quant and Verbal, so unless you score really bad in IR in your practice exams, there is no real need for specific IR practice
-	Same goes for AWA. I just followed the structure outlined in this [article]( Your grammar and vocab skills will increase if you study for verbal, so no need to specifically study for AWA. stats:
-TTP Quant accuracy: 93%
-TTP Verbal accuracy: 93%

0,"I am taking the GMAT in 25 days and I’m really struggling with SC. I come from a country where English isn’t the first language, but the medium of communication all through school and university had been English for me. (I majored in English Literature for my bachelors ). I’ve never struggled with grammar or the language as such but I’ve come to realise verbal in GMAT is a whole different ball-game, specially for non-native speakers, with it being less colloquial and more formal. It feels like everything I knew about the language has been a lie 😩
Coming to the exam, I am looking to improve my verbal score. I’ve only taken 2 OG mocks so far, and the scores for verbal have been v35 and V38. Since the last mock, Ive practiced even more problems for SC, RC and CR so I am confident that with a little more push V40 wouldn’t be that far fetched when I take the next mock, however  V45+ will be if I don’t get better at SC. I have the Manhattan Prep guide for SC but every time I try to go through it I’m overwhelmed by info and unable to keep up. 
I can’t spend money right now so I’m looking for free resources on grammar rules, idioms, strategies, tips &amp; tricks, and everything else I might need - preferably at one place without having to spend more than 2-3 days on getting foundation right. I can spend upto 3 hours a day on verbal. Once I’m done with that, my plan is to redo the questions I got wrong in the OG, do random questions on gmatclub and use the remaining 4 OG mocks as further practice. 
Could anyone here link me to resources they’ve found helpful? Any other recommendations on strategy would be of great help as well. Pleaseeee!",Struggling with SC! Help with resources?,1632846928,8,365,1
0,"First attempt was feb 2020 and I got a 580. I got the OG and just went through problems. Didn’t really understand the OG guide for those I got incorrect and clearly my score reflected It. I didn’t know the tips and tricks.  a few months off and got manhattan prep. Went through both verbal and quant. Quant didn’t really resonate with me although I tried to get better. I just wasn’t understanding. I will give them credit when It comes to verbal, except for sentence correction. They really taught me how get verbal questions right. 2nd attempt was January 2021 after moderate use of Manhattan prep. 37 verbal 35 quant. Ouch.  TTP 6 months ago. I went through the entire course religiously. I payed for one month as a test then decided to do 4 months in one bundle to help with cost. TTP gives you stats and at the end of the program, I put in 200 hours - this is having done every single lesson and every single problem (yes, all 2000+ of them). I didn’t focus a ton on verbal during this time, so I only did TTP quant. I just can’t say enough about how good this program is. I saw on here someone asked if It was a scam because they saw such glowing reviews…. Nope, real deal. I finished TTP about a month ago and went into OG practice problems and tests. I took 4 of the practice tests and went through the OG guide problems for all sections each day (about 50-80 questions a day, verbal included) to keep myself fresh. Well, got the 730 today. After my initial experience with the gmat, I never thought I could do It. I got a 48 verbal and 44 quant. Time to put this chapter behind me… thank you TTP",580 to 730,1632617575,3,355,1

I’ve been studying for the GMAT for about 7 months now and took my first official GMAT Online this past weekend only to find that my score has dropped from the low-700s to a whopping 510. It’s safe to say I’m absolutely devastated with this and am feeling pretty overwhelmed so I figured I’d turn to Reddit for advice. Been studying for a long time, hit 700s in Official mocks, dropped to 510 in Official Online Test, now very sad and very lost. What should I do? **Target Schools** \- INSEAD, GSB, HBS, Columbia, Kellogg, MIT Sloan, NYU Stern
* **Application Time** \- Round 2 for Fall 2022 start
* **GMAT Score** \- Aiming for at least 710 (I feel like I have a unique background so I'm not planning to lean on my score anyway)
* **Resources:** Manhattan Prep Course, TGS, TTP, Gmatninja, OG/Wiley (obviously)
* **Undergrad:** 3.75 GPA, Double Major + Minor, Top regional US school (top 75 Nationally)
* **Fun Note:** I relocated from Silicon Valley at the beginning of the pandemic the rural area I grew up in and currently live about 3 hours from the nearest test center so the GMAT online is my main option. (longish) Story so Far:** start out, I have pretty bad ADHD and have always gotten test accommodations so I knew that this endeavor would be extra hard for me on top of my already stressful job (with weird hours to boot) and I would have to be ruthless about prioritizing studying. I decided to start by signing up for Manhattan Prep’s 9-week course starting early April and spent about a month prior to that reading through the majority of MPrep’s Foundations of Math because I knew that Quant would be hard for me (classic American). During the MPrep course, I did every single homework problem and read and reread all of the MPrep Books (All the Verbal/Quant, Foundations of Verbal/Quant, and the companion guides) and kept an error log for every question I did. I also started obsessively consuming [u/TheGMATStrategy]( podcast every time I went for a run or bike ride (which is often considering my ADHD); I’ve found Isaac’s insights to be foundational for my test-taking strategy and mindset. each CAT I spend \~5 hours reviewing each question, making flashcards, and reviewing my notes to track my weaknesses and strengths in a Google Sheet so I know what I need to work on before my next CAT. After finishing my MPrep class, I figured I would take two weeks off work to study full time and take the official test in July (at that point I had been studying for \~4.5 months). Unfortunately, I had to deal with some family issues and fly home so my studying got derailed a little bit and I decided to push off my official test date until I could get around a 700 in an official mock. By the end of July, I felt pretty stagnant with my Quant so I signed up for TTP and went through the first few modules. My weaknesses in quant had primarily been around number properties and linear algebra and TPP literally changed the way I see numbers. I decided to take an official mock armed with my new TTP skillz and managed to hit my all-time highest Quant (Q45), just needed to bring my Verbal back up and we’d be set. I signed up for my official test date with enough time to take another practice exam the weekend before. I figured if I had hit a 690 in an official mock, I would probably be able to clean up a few things and hit the mark on test day. I doubled down on TTP and Gmatninja videos and two weeks later finally hit the 700 mark (Q42/V44). Let’s Go! one week later (this past Saturday) I sat for my Official Online GMAT. I spent most of the week reviewing my error log and doing practice questions from the OG where I consistently got most questions right. On test day, I definitely felt anxious and had a hard time sleeping the night before but knew that I had studied a ton and I felt prepared with my strategy. I’d gotten a Q45 and V44 in the last two tests so I just needed to stay strong and hit both this time to get my 720. I’ve gotten in the habit of doing a few OG questions as a warmup before starting the test and I was feeling solid. The proctor took about a half-hour to get me checked in so I ended up starting a bit late but other than that I didn’t notice any issues with the test delivery. Quant is my weakest area so I like to get it out of the way and take it while my brain is fresh. I honestly felt pretty good during the Quant section and only saw a handful of questions where I had to take a strategic guess. I kept reminding myself that I’ve gotten a 45 before and I could do it again. I finished the section right on time and felt like I had scored at least a 43. At question 18 on Verbal, I felt like I was beginning to waver but Verbal has been my strongest subject and I hit a 44 in my previous mock so I just needed to hold to that or fix the handful of mistakes I made last time. I finished both sections, let out a sigh of relief, and headed into IR and AWA. 12 IR questions and one essay later, I clicked “finish”. Instead of the 710-720 I had been visualizing for the last 7 months I saw a 510. No this can’t be right, that 5 should be a 7, I scored Q45/V39 and Q43/V44 on my last two Official GMAT Mocks so I had to get a *minimum* 650 right? My heart dropped and I felt like I was going to pass out, throw up, scream, or all three. I don’t remember clicking out of the secure browser and I don’t even remember my score breakdown (Q28/V31?). I eventually settled on laying on the floor, screaming into a pillow for a few minutes...I was and am absolutely devastated I have spent the majority of my waking hours and free time for 7 months studying for this thing to get a 510. now, I think I’m going to sign up for another attempt in two weeks but I feel like if I don’t get my score on that attempt, I won’t have time for Round 2 apps. I also live really far from a test center and would prefer to not have to do an in-person test (the nearest city with 100K people is \~3 hours away). At that point, I’m completely lost. I have no idea what went wrong. I felt great while taking the test but was stunned by such a huge gap in my scores and I'm afraid to fail again on another attempt. How do I know this won't happen again? When should I just give up? Should I just focus on my apps and hail-mary apply to schools with screenshots of my mocks to illustrate my abilities despite my unofficial score? I feel like I have a unique enough background to be a good fit for my target programs I'm kidding myself to think I could do anything with a 510. I hate that my business acumen and abilities have to be tested through high school math and grammar but I know I can't do anything about that...

I doubled down on TTP and Gmatninja videos and two weeks later finally hit the 700 mark (Q42/V44). Let’s Go! one week later (this past Saturday) I sat for my Official Online GMAT. I spent most of the week reviewing my error log and doing practice questions from the OG where I consistently got most questions right. On test day, I definitely felt anxious and had a hard time sleeping the night before but knew that I had studied a ton and I felt prepared with my strategy. I’d gotten a Q45 and V44 in the last two tests so I just needed to stay strong and hit both this time to get my 720. I’ve gotten in the habit of doing a few OG questions as a warmup before starting the test and I was feeling solid. The proctor took about a half-hour to get me checked in so I ended up starting a bit late but other than that I didn’t notice any issues with the test delivery. Quant is my weakest area so I like to get it out of the way and take it while my brain is fresh. I honestly felt pretty good during the Quant section and only saw a handful of questions where I had to take a strategic guess. I kept reminding myself that I’ve gotten a 45 before and I could do it again. I finished the section right on time and felt like I had scored at least a 43. At question 18 on Verbal, I felt like I was beginning to waver but Verbal has been my strongest subject and I hit a 44 in my previous mock so I just needed to hold to that or fix the handful of mistakes I made last time. I finished both sections, let out a sigh of relief, and headed into IR and AWA. 12 IR questions and one essay later, I clicked “finish”. Instead of the 710-720 I had been visualizing for the last 7 months I saw a 510. No this can’t be right, that 5 should be a 7, I scored Q45/V39 and Q43/V44 on my last two Official GMAT Mocks so I had to get a *minimum* 650 right? My heart dropped and I felt like I was going to pass out, throw up, scream, or all three. I don’t remember clicking out of the secure browser and I don’t even remember my score breakdown (Q28/V31?). I eventually settled on laying on the floor, screaming into a pillow for a few minutes...I was and am absolutely devastated I have spent the majority of my waking hours and free time for 7 months studying for this thing to get a 510. now, I think I’m going to sign up for another attempt in two weeks but I feel like if I don’t get my score on that attempt, I won’t have time for Round 2 apps. I also live really far from a test center and would prefer to not have to do an in-person test (the nearest city with 100K people is \~3 hours away). At that point, I’m completely lost. I have no idea what went wrong. I felt great while taking the test but was stunned by such a huge gap in my scores and I'm afraid to fail again on another attempt. How do I know this won't happen again? When should I just give up? Should I just focus on my apps and hail-mary apply to schools with screenshots of my mocks to illustrate my abilities despite my unofficial score? I feel like I have a unique enough background to be a good fit for my target programs I'm kidding myself to think I could do anything with a 510.

0,"Update on my previous post... I've sat a few proper mocks now and scored 740 on Manhattan Prep and 710 on [MBA.com]( first test.  Still pretty cold sitting these and find myself time pressured towards the end which I'm sure is where I'm dropping 2-3 levels on the final 5 questions.  However, on the first Princeton Review test I scored only 610 despite only getting 5 wrong for each of V and Q. of me thinks on the basis they guarantee 700 only if you score 620 on the first test there may be a bit of jiggery pokery going on here.  I'd add for completeness my incorrect answers were spread (not the first 5), the test just never let me get to the high questions whereas on the Manhattan test almost all my questions were 700-800 graded. correction I'm doing 90% by ear so I know getting that back up to 44 is going to be hard work but the Quant is starting to come to me easier with the exception of the Geometry, which I just need to relearn and I'm sure is what is costing me nudging up to 50-51. interested in any comments anyone may have.",The path to 790 commences,1631379109,5,221,1

0,"Hi,
I am facing a big dilemma. To understand my dilemma I’d like to quickly explain my situation.
Started preparing in April 2021, took online classes and worked hours and hours, focused on 700-800 level questions. After practice I took mocks from mba.com and scored 700-750 on 4 mocks (2 free and 2 paid).
In August, took the real gmat in the test centre and scored horribly. V21 and Q48. 570 total which I rejected.
I started practicing again as I couldn’t accept such a low score.
I bought Manhattan mock tests and after practicing again, I’m unable to reach 700+ level in Manhattan mocks.
I don’t understand how to improve further. I’ve tried all sources and in terms of practice I don’t think i have missed out on anything.

0,Hey guys I took a cold GMAT test and scored a 610. Q41 V32. In verbal I got less than half marks in SC and about 70-75 percent in RC and CR.  was originally planning on taking the gmat for a MIM but decided against that and am now thinking of an MBA program later on so I can move/work in the US. (British national). bought TTP and went through the quant and scored 95-89-75 in the e-m-h tests but when I really really slowed down it was closer to 99-94-80. So I feel I have quant covered to get a Q49-50.  I’m taking the gmat in two years time (this year I’m building my CV). However I am planning on starting verbal prep now for a year before I restart quant . I want to go through the Manhattan books/TTP guides meticulously and then go through every LSAT paper and OG question.  My aim is for a Q50-V44/45.  a 32 to 45 possible in verbal? I know a lot of my mistakes were in SC so if I can improve that to nearly perfect and improve my CR and RC as I was then I think there’s a chance? I can spend unlimited time on verbal and improving my reading so I’m hoping this jump is possible. Am I being overly optimistic?

0,"Hey y'all, I'd share my experience with the GMAT in case it can be of use to anyone. Diagnostic 630 ---&gt; 740 on official exam in three months. started studying back in May by taking a class my university offers (although I graduated in 2018). My initial diagnostic through Kaplan was ovr 630 q37 v39, which was fairly encouraging given I'd only put in one week. Quant is def my weak area, especially compared to the super genius engineers that seem to take this test-- shout out to you all for ruining the curve for dumbos like me :) For context, I'm a white US citizen, Finance undergrad, career in program management in fintech banking. class was marginally helpful, but the geometry I learned definitely stuck. I think I got a lot more but going my own route. second practice test was again Kaplan a few weeks later, where I scored ovr 640 q38 v40. I was pretty devastated by the minimal improvement, although cut myself some slack considering I slept very poorly the night before.  tried to study 1-2 hours daily, 6 days per week. I usually started by reviewing problems I had missed in practice tests or question banks, then moving on to new problems. I also found youtube videos EXTREMELY helpful. Magoosh and Manhattan have a ton of free videos there, meant to entice you to purchase their programs, but when you consider that there are 10+ test prep companies also doing this, most topics you could want are covered. I would often leverage these videos as I commuted to and from work (many can be consumed without actually seeing the screen). I also practiced using the OG question banks. next practice test a GMAT Official Practice test #2. I scored ovr 700 q42 v44. I was ecstatic because &gt;700 was always the goal, and I still had about a month left to study. I'm not sure why I did so much better on the Official practice test. I've heard the math in Kap is more difficult, but I can't say for certain I noticed that.  the course of my last month, I stuck to the same routine of reviewing problems I had missed and then working on new ones, watching youtube to learn new concepts and also leveraging GMAT Club heavily for problems I couldn't figure out (Official Practice Tests don't have solutions).  took Official tests 4 and 6 and scored ovr 710 q45 v42 and ovr 710 q44 v42. I should mention an issue that I ran into during both of these practice tests. As I began the quant sections, I came upon 
 a question both times very early that I knew how to do but just couldn't figure out. I could tell this would be considered an easy question, so this absolutely wrecked my psyche. In one of those practice tests, when I hit this point I straight up stopped the exam. I thought that there was no use in continuing since I had used 5 mins on one easy question that I likely missed. I decided to keep going though, and was glad I did.  last test was about a week before my actual test, so I assumed I had topped out at 710 (which to me was great!). I was hoping to hit 700-720 on the actual exam, but was nervous after hearing stories of people getting scores way lower than their practice tests.  day before the exam, I did no studying at all. I had a pit in my stomach for the entire week of the exam too. I never became super nervous for tests in college, but this one got to me. day came and I made sure to eat a light lunch and watch funny videos before my test. I arrived and the center feeling nervous, but confident that I had done all I could do to prepare. When I began the test, my heart dropped as one of the first quant questions was an easy work rate problem, and for some reason my brain could never wrap my head around those. Definitely my weakest of the common quant types. I started to panic, much as I did in previous practice tests when I knew I missed an easy question. But, I pushed on anyway with laser focus. I knew it was make or break time I guess and I had promised myself I would finish the exam no matter what just to get any kind of score.  thought that I had done a poor job in quant. Verbal felt really good. I was so focused and managed my time very well. If you asked me how I performed overall, I would have guessed 680-700. When I hit submit and saw my 740, I felt like crying. I thought it was a mistake. I was PUMPED. IR was 8, too. back, I still don't know why I did so much better than I had on the latest practice tests, but I do know that I set myself up for maximum success by doing literally every tip I saw online (dressing up, plenty of sleep, no studying on test day, words of affirmation, and, of course, lots of previous study to give me confidence).  I'm just way stoked to have this behind me. It was a long journey but has given me not only a weapon in my holster when applying to B schools, but also self confidence that I can take beyond.  happy to answer any questions, and good luck to each of you in jour GMAT journey.",Done with the GMAT forever,1629754383,5,1055,1

I was even able to solve official 700 level GMAT questions confidently while practicing. in this attempt, the GMAT threw me a lot of questions just based on writing style, idioms, and diction. There were very few questions, if not any, on typical which/that, past-perfect, comparisons, parallelisms. Ultimately, my timing went off the window and I had to rush in an RC and guess on the last 3 questions in the last quarter as you can see and my score dropped drastically. I have no choice but to forget applications in R1 and take a last re-attempt in R2, which is just after a month.  some expert please guide me on this?

I completed all of quant TTP before my first OGPractice test but didn’t want to bother with the verbal portion because it was in beta mode and since it wasn’t integrated with quant I didn’t want to go back to it.  went through 3 tutors and the 2nd one flat out gave up on me and didn’t think I could improve. The 3rd one made the difference. I started using LSAT books which improved my score drastically in 1.5 months.  verbal was doing well, even the 3rd tutor doubted whether I could get a decent score due to the constant careless mistakes I made day in and day out. I took a practice test the next morning after he told me that and got a 680 as well as cancelled services. Scheduled the test for 2 weeks later and ended up with a 690 today.  this isn’t for those targeting 750+, but it is a post if you’re looking for motivation to continue.

0,"TL:DR: After reading the manhattan prep theory and with no question practice I got 690 Q46,V39. I have about one month to improve, quant can be improved with practice I believe, verbal, only 1-2 mistakes on RC and IR combined, however I got almost all of my SC wrong, any tips on improving SC?
ALSO question: how well does the official mba.com test represent the real Gmat in difficulty, can I expect a similar score if I did the gmat tomorrow?

 I read all of the 9 manhattan prep books, then today I did my first practice test on mba.com (practice exam 1), and got a score of 690 (Q46, V39) and IR 7. am planning to do the real GMAT exam in about a month (early september), and while a 690 would be good enough, obviously the higher the better so I would like to try to get 720-740 if possible. a few info and questions: I have all the OG practice guide books, I did not do any question from these yet, and the manhattan advanced quant book. Would practicing from these be sufficient to achieve the 700+, or is anything else recommended? quant: I expected a higher score, I did quite a few stupid mistakes, and blanked out a bit during the test, I think I think I should have the knowledge, but with a bit more practice and mental prep this should be fine, but any advice is welcome. Verbal: I only made 1-2 minor mistakes on IR and RC questions, I am not a native english speaker, but I attended an english school and english enviroment for quite a few years, so my reading and speaking are close to a native level, however my grammar is terrible. I had no clue how to do the SC questions, I guessed most of them -incorrectly at that-, so there is a lot of room to improve in SC. Any good youtube video guides, or practice material for SC that could help me out in this? Again, this verbal score is not bad, and if I get my quant up to Q50-Q51 then with the same verbal as now I would get 730-740, but I have a month to improve on it, so why not try it? I had 2-3 min left on quant, I could have balanced it out a bit better, but for a first try it wasn't too bad, I did waste some time on some questions, which I ended up guessing, I will try to improve on this on my 2. try. For verbal I had around 10-15mins left, because as I mentioned earlier, I guessed most of the SC questions, since I was clueless. This time could be spent on the SC questions properly once I know how to do them. I have one concern: How well does this mba.com practice exam reflect the difficulty of the real GMAT? I mean, does a 690 score on the practice mean I can achieve 690 on the real test, or the practice exam is much easier? I see people mention test anxiety, but oddly enough I was anxious and nervous even during the practice test, -the reason for my weaker than expected quant performance- so I think that part won't be worse on the real exam, I'm just worried that the practice exam is much easier and doesn't reflect a realistic score.

I thought I'd seek your counsel - long post alert  I have a friend named, let's say Kevin. Now Kevin is my childhood bestfriend and I love him so this post is in no way meant to put him down.  anyways, so we've been at the prep game for almost an year now. We literally grew up together, we have the same family and educational backgrounds (school and college degrees, literally same class). Both have good-ish GPAs (3.7+). Our paths diverged after college when I got into this Mumbai-based BB and he got into Media. That's the only difference. Same # of WE, about 5. As a girl (not being sexist lol) I was a just bit more nerdy than he was and got marginally better grades.  went through the motions: Manhattan, Kaplan videos, GMATClub tests, OG, OG mocks, etc. After 11 months of half-assed prep (I'll admit) in Feb this year, we both took the exam. I scored a 670 (Q43 V39) and he scored a 620 (Q40 V something).. and this was no surprise because it in line with our mocks. We both decided to stop cocking about and get serious. Unfortunately, in March and April I slowed down because everyone at home kinda got covid and it was just a menace. He switched up to GRE in the interim, and in two months rocked a 328 (164, 164 split).. he makes it sound soo easy and is still convincing me to jump ship.. I was determined not to but when I saw a 328 is above the average scores of most M7s, I got tempted and gave a mock GRE without having any idea about the exam. I scored a 163 (brushing aside the fact I got destroyed in verbal..) but still i was like whaaa. I'm by no means a Q47/Q48 typa girl, atleast not right now. Yet as per the GRE percentiles, I was. the thing. 'Kevin' has been telling me since GRE doesn't have DS, or that annoying question-wise algorithm, it's easier on quant. As far as verbal is concerned (I take this with a pinch of salt) - he says with brute force of mugging up vocab and practicing, you can get it.  I'm faced with a question: do I stick with my GMAT prep (I really want to because I've been obsessing about it for so long) or do I move over to the GRE (tempting as it sounds)?

  1. Your overall process to start preparing for the GMAT Start with [a diagnostic test]( What are your specific strengths and weaknesses? [an error log]( to discern the patterns. Put all questions you got wrong in the error log, and see which sorts of questions you tend to struggle with. The analytics section of the app will help. Do questions to focus on your weaknesses. Really try to understand the process of how to solve questions: you’ll find a lot of examples online. Ask yourself why certain techniques are used, and why your initial instinct may be wrong. worry about speed, that comes with being confident and fluent in the techniques. As the old Army saying goes, “Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.” Focus on being smooth in your application of techniques. Once you feel like you’ve covered your initial weaknesses, or you feel confused about about what to do next, take another practice test. Then start with a) again. There are two parts to studying for the GMAT. part is like being a marathon runner. You need to put the miles in on the pavement to run a marathon. Anyone can do it, but it takes effort. Doing questions, getting them wrong, and then learning how to do them correctly through the error log is the equivalent of putting those miles in. It’s going to suck, but that’s how you learn. second part is like being your own coach. You need to reflect on your own progress and what you get wrong and right. What are the patterns in what you get wrong? What techniques do you have difficulty applying? 2.

Your GMAT study plan speaking, you need to work 100 hours (intelligently) to improve 100 points on the GMAT. This is, of course, a very rough estimate, and depends heavily on the *quality* of the hours you put into studying. reasonable way to accomplish this is to plan to work for 20 hours a week for 2 months (giving yourself room for breaks and slow days). That means working 2 hours per day on the weekdays, and 5 hours per day on the weekends. for the GMAT should be a sprint.

How to review the GMAT sections is both how you should approach the questions, and, more importantly, how to analyze a question you got incorrect through the error log is the key to learning Reading Comprehension: what precisely did I need to read to get the correct answer? Critical Reasoning: how does the argument work (premise, reasoning, conclusion)? How does the correct answer fit into the argument? Sentence Correction: how does the correct answer correct and efficiently convey the meaning? Problem Solving: what equations do I need to start with? how do I get from there to the answers?

0," All - I just took the GMAT online and scored a 700 48Q 38V. Unfortunately they do not provide ESRs for online. started TTP two months ago, after I had hit 700 on an official diagnostic with the same split as my test result. Prior I had gone through manhattan prep and was doing OG problems. My goal was mainly to improve my verbal to mid 40s and to supplement the quant knowledge I was weak at. Objectively, based on my gmat club official questions error log, I’ve gotten much better at verbal, especially in critical reasoning and reading comprehension, the only questions I get wrong now are the highly controversial questions. However, my overall score has not improved. I think this is largely due to me still not having mastery on sentence correction. I still average close to 2 minutes per question, which takes time away from critical reasoning and reading, questions I almost never get wrong when practicing question by question in a non test setting. I read that sentence correction should take about 1 minute 30 seconds to save time for the other questions.  I always rush through the last third of the test when I realize I am running out of time. Most of the questions I get wrong in my official diagnostics are questions that upon second glance are quite easy, which makes me think I am getting them wrong because of the lack of time. Interestingly enough I’ve decreased the number of verbal questions I get wrong from 12 to around 6-7 now but the score has stayed the same.  did rush the verbal content on TTP as I was more focused on finishing the course rather than learning to achieve mastery. I have found the material to be incredibly helpful and I’m surprised my scores have not reflected any improvement. For most of the TTP chapter tests, I have hit the benchmarks. On official practice questions, I get 80% of the 600-700 level sentence correction questions and around 60% of the 700 level questions. For reading comprehension and critical reasoning I get almost all questions right. probably have a poor foundation in grammar compared to others, I studied math in college and verbal was by far my weakest section on the SATs. I think my problems with SC arise from the way I’m studying. Often times when I do problems I do not go through every answer choice to find their flaws and am satisfied once I get the right answer. you can provide some guidance on how I can make the improvements necessary on verbal while maintaining or improving quant, that would be greatly appreciated.

0,"Overall feeling very happy that my efforts are getting rewarded. I took the exam once before on April 30th and scored a 640 (Q48, V30, IR8) and canceled the score since I was aiming for a 650+ to keep it. I posted here in the forum right after and sought advice on how to improve my verbal score and on methods to reach my target score of 760. Since I belong to an overrepresented pool of applicants, I feel 750+ gives me a good chance during the application evaluation. had prepared for my first try starting January end, took off the whole of Feb and half of March due to personal reasons, and got back on the preparation horse for an April end exam date. Used OG Prep test 1 as a cold mock back in January and scored a 640. I mainly relied on Magoosh premium to get my basics sorted since my understanding of verbal basics was atrocious. When I started, for the life of me, I could not tell what a verb or a noun was and needed something light and descriptive to get me through the basics of verbal. I had a good amount of confidence in my Quant ability and skimmed through topics that I needed a brushing upon. Now looking back, I feel I was grossly unprepared for the beast of an exam GMAT is and took it too lightly hoping to end up in the 700's with mock scores that were consistently in the Mid 600s. Reality struck with the 640 scores and had to recalibrate my approach to thoroughly understand what GMAT tests and how to get hold of the exam. I subscribed to other resources such as GMATClub and Manhattan test prep to aid my preparation and slowly my mock scores went up the 700s, with my last mock before the test ending up at a steady 720.  test day was normal, had a morning 9 am slot and I was up from 5 onwards to ward off the sleepiness. I had gotten acquainted with the test center invigilator last time and hence was able to request him for a bigger monitor and better chair this time around. This time around I switched the order to V-Q-IR-AWA  hoping it would give me the extra freshness in verbal. Time management was the biggest issue I faced in the verbal section, unnecessarily spending precious seconds on few questions repeatedly, and ending up with eight questions in the last 10 minutes forced me to give up an entire RC to guesses. I wasn't satisfied with my verbal performance and it took an effort to keep that from not interfering with my quant section. The quant section was a literal breeze through. I finished the first 20 questions with 25 minutes to spare and spent the next 10 with enough time to spare. Although the initial quant questions seemed easier than usual, the latter half was more challenging. IR didn't start off well as I took a full 5 minutes for the first question but still ended the section with three minutes to spare. The final score had exceeded my expectations since verbal ended up being a disaster for me.  though 730 is a good score, I feel I could have done better on the verbal section and crossed the 40 marks had I managed time better. This is pushing me towards another try in the next couple of months, but I'm not sure whether that time would be better spent on applications. I work 13 hours a day on two projects and find time in between, after work and on weekends to prepare for the GMAT. Would love to know the thoughts of the sub on this part.  again, this sub and its contributors have been helpful during my preparation.

What’s worse, I didn’t feel like I had any mastery over the content. I wish I had gone with the traditional providers of Manhattan gmat and saved my time and money claims of:
- Get your best possible GMAT score in record speed, (8hours a day for 3 months is not record speed nor learning smart)
- thanks to our adaptive learning technology, (their “AI” forces you to go through the content, no matter what. No matter if you feel that you have already mastered that content)
- premium content, (their content is self made, and has many errors. You cannot choose what to focus on - definitely not the difficulty level so that you see progression and can move onto other topics. You can’t save any questions either to build up an error log)
- and elite tutors (you’re better off searching for a better and more comprehensive answer on beat the gmat) complete BS. were also quite uncooperative in giving me back any of my money, and even asked me to pay even more money to continue to use the service in order to get my money back. “free” program is a scam.

Most of the increase is attributable to improvement in pacing and not leaving any questions blank. I feel pretty comfortable with the Quant section (thank you TTP) but i'm still not exactly where I need to at for Verbal.  used ManhattanPrep GMAT for the Verbal section and while i've improved significantly for Sentence Correction, I'm having trouble with the Reading Comprehension and Critical Reasoning questions. Specifically, I find that it's hard to implement Manhattan Prep's strategy of taking bullet point notes and answering the questions on time. When I take my time, I more often than not end up at the right answer, but it results in leaving questions unanswered at the end.  anyone have any tips for answering RC and CR questions that has worked for them?

0,"Hi Folks! you're in this forum you all must know the struggle of trying to determine a solid study plan for the GMAT. Trying to breakdown the various sections, and sub-sections and formulate a study plan that is both comprehensive and at the same time easy to follow. But typically, this can mean buying several books be that manhattan prep guides, OG guides, the list goes on and then there's one book for each sub-topic in the GMAT!! What an expensive nightmare!!  this, I took to GMAT Club, Youtube, Reddit, wherever else I could go to vet and define the most precise and yet effective GMAT conquering strategy. And honestly, all those hours of investigation later, I decided to invest in TTP, both for it's solid reputation and all round value for money (they do verbal now too!) I was curious to know if all the hype around TTP was legit, and so I started with the 5 day free trial. But to my delight, it was in fact, damn good! And I went on to invest in the 1 month subscription of the course - which I later extended to the 4 month version. I've currently parked my GMAT goals, as I realised I won't be looking to do my MBA any time in the next 5 years. Hence, I can't tell you how my marks went after using TTP, but I will say, when I do return to GMAT prep, I will be right back on TTP without even thinking about it (it's just such good value!!)  The course is sooo well laid out. The founders have even gone to the extent of consolidating everything you need to prepare into the one study plan/platform. Right from a Calendar to mark the days in the lead up to the exam. A review sheet where you can follow along each chapter with and simply plug in your notes to their pre-made templates and MOST importantly, the MUST KNOW section, which summarises the absolute key notes from each quant topic. It's honestly soo good, I wanna just go back and study lol. 
2. The course is soo fkn comprehensive it's nuts. like it breaks down everything and builds your knowledge of each area of math, ground up, ensuring there are no gaps(or bridges any gaps that may have existed).  It's a comprehensive course. It's super extensive and thorough and just be sure not to expect 'some get rich quick' or 'instant coffee' like solution to GMAT Domination. It will sit you down and build you up brick by brick. But this is actually a huge pro in my eyes, but dunno, you may see it differently.  than that, I just wanted to say, I absolutely loved my experience with TTP so far. And for those similar to me, who are looking to consolidate all the confusion of GMAT prep strategy, and get one robust and efficient study plan. Honestly, look no further than TTP. I've done the investigation, spent those hours, and then only invested my money. so I totally get it. But TTP rose to the occasion.  Luck folks!

 Summary - don't take the exam to heart. If nothing works, trust vodka.  am probably one of the worst test-takers in history. I made my first attempt in 2015 when I was in my final year of college to apply for one of those early admissions MBA colleges have. (Attempt 1&amp;2)**For my first attempt, I used E-GMAT for verbal and official guides for quant. I prepared for about 2 months, scored 680-700 in mocks, and was fairly confident of scoring a 650+. But I scored a disappointing 550, majorly attributable to the horrible exam center. The center had a seating arrangement for 2 people only and was extremely small, making me feel claustrophobic. I gave another attempt 15 days later at a different center and scored 680. Q50, V31 didn't make it to those colleges. 3)**I started thinking about MBA and wanted to apply in the next 2 years. I started my prep again in July. I wanted a 700+ this time to be able to apply for my target schools. I joined one of those in-person coaching centers. I prepared really hard for about 4 months, scored decently around 700-720 in mocks, and gave another Attempt in Oct 2017. I scored a 570. My anxiety fucked me. took a break for about a month and planned to regive again by Jan 2018. (Attempt 4)** 2018 - 640. Q48, V29. I lost all interest in the exam (Attempt 5)** peers have started going out for MBA. I have this FOMO now. I wanted to give yet another attempt, and I sat down again. I Bought e-gmat, manhattan, and all of the official prep. Around 3 months later, I got a 650. just started making myself miserable and was not ready to let go of the exam.  5 attempts, what harm will one more do? (Attempt 6)** hit; plans got a little delayed. Started prep again in July. Unfortunately, I got a panic attack before the exam, which screwd up my mind. October - Scored a 670. Q49, V31. this time, my earlier 680 score expired. So what's the harm in giving one more attempt? (Attempt 7 &amp; 8)** started practicing meditation. I unlearned everything I knew. I started from the basics. I joined an online course, which was really helpful. My foundation was getting stronger. My mocks(veritas prep, as I have exhausted my official ones) showed steep improvement. I was scoring from 720-750 on them. I was confident in my abilities. I was not confident in my mental composure. Fucked up real bad. March - Scored 680 Q49, V33. I made peace with the fact that my ability is probably only at 680 levels. I felt it was futile to waste more time on this, accepted that I am shitty at this exam, and started with applications. If not Harvard, I will go to Chicago State. I was done with this exam. it didn't feel right to leave it on the 7th attempt. So, why leave the final attempt?

I really appreciated the ease of communicating with the TTP folks using their chat feature; it felt like I had a tutor without paying extra per hour.  been a long-time lurker from my other account on this subreddit throughout my prep journey. It's been inspirational to see the progress of others on here, and that has kept me going even when I didn't think I was going to get my target score (700+). I made plenty of mistakes during the prep process, and I hope others can learn from this post and avoid the mistakes themselves.  Course &amp; All The Verbal/Quant books:**  prep started with the Manhattan books, which had favorable reviews on this subreddit. The books are good no doubt, but they don't provide a well-rounded understanding of the content tested on the GMAT. Their strategies for each question type are decent, but not something that would take a sub-500 scorer to the 700s (at least it did not work in my case). I signed up for the manhattan prep virtual classes thinking that would help round out my understanding and study approach to the GMAT. This was my biggest mistake. The course was a complete waste of money, and I pretty much only learned really crappy ""tips and tricks"" that were just gimmicks. Gimmicks do not work for getting a top score. I spent nearly 3 months doing this crap and had no significant progress to show for it after the classes concluded. My mock test score at the beginning of the course was 550, and 590 at the end of the course. I think the score increase here can be attributed to not leaving any section unfinished. The tutor also didn't seem invested in the progress of students, and I had plenty of emails go unanswered. One takeaway from Manhattan that helped me a lot is their timing strategy. The strategy is intuitive and does not take long to set up in the booklets.   signed up for TTP on the day of my last manhattan session, and that was the turning point. The Quant sections are legendary, as many others have already raved about. Follow the process they set out for you. Marty tells almost everyone asking for advice on this subreddit to slow down and understand why each answer choice is right/wrong. THIS is the way. TTP tells you when to start timing yourself, and I generally never had an issue with timing on the Quant section after starting TTP. The verbal section of TTP is also incredibly valuable to learn all of the material on the GMAT. Sentence correction questions are reasonable to drill the concepts, but I wish there were more questions during the review phase. Critical Reasoning on TTP is super tough…The hard questions are generally way harder than the average 700-level GMAT question. Going through each hard test was game-changing; I could finally understand how to reason my way through each question and not rely on gimmicks. 

 TTP requires you to review content periodically to break the forgetting curve, embedding the quant strategies in your arsenal. The review did not work too well for me on SC and CR as I pretty much remembered questions and could not extract any more out of each type. I also began to notice that I would start to forget CR strategies as I spent a few days reviewing SC, and vice versa. This was another big mistake I made because even though I retained the concepts, I did not develop/retain the strategies to solve verbal questions on-time. My recommendation, if you are facing a similar situation, is to start using the GMATClub question banks during reviews to do small sets. Sort by views/kudos and pay attention to the source to ensure you don't learn from bad examples. Reputable test prep companies usually have decent questions, and the write-ups from experts are generally insightful. The GMATclub error log is automatic and is a great way to refresh the set of questions you are learning from during each review session. This mistake in my review phase was costly because I was unable to solve verbal questions on-time leading to a poor score in my 3rd mock (630).  on YouTube:**  browsing a few posts on here about strategies that worked for others, I turned to the GMATninja youtube videos. My CR was still fairly strong thanks to TTP, but I was running way over time on SC and RC. Charles/GMATninja is really the reason why I was able to go from 630 just a few days before my test to a 720 (jump from V30 to V40). I learned how to apply the knowledge from TTP to GMAT questions to quickly find and eliminate answer on SC. I went from averaging about 2 min per SC to about 1 minute. I went 100% on SC questions in my official test. I also learned how to approach RC passages from this video series (note-taking, how to read passages regardless of content) since RC was not in TTP by the time I finished my review. GMATninja helped me translate my CR strategies to RC questions.  also read and reread his beginner's guides on SC, CR, and RC on GMATClub. It might be a beginner's guide, but it is extremely useful to help you come back to the bigger picture after diving into the details with each section of TTP.  Efficient Learning:**  final couple of days before my official test were spent doing practice timed sets using OG questions on Wiley Efficient Learning using the GMAT pad and marker. The online platform has an extra 100 questions. I only went through a quarter of the overall verbal questions because of time constraints. I did not feel the need to supplement my TTP quant practice with OG questions because the TTP's questions are really similar to the real deal.  literature:**  TTP course has a number of readings throughout the course that help you navigate through each phase of the study journey. If you do not subscribe to TTP, they still have an enormous amount of content on their blog that anyone can read for free. I particularly benefitted from their write-ups on dealing with test-day anxiety. There are a lot of good guides on GMATClub that are more specific and may be beneficial to those who are stuck.  I could have kept going at this to pursue a score higher than 720 since I still have plenty of weak areas to work on and plenty of practice material in-hand, but I am choosing not to since I have other priorities and I reached my target of 700+.  last bit of advice is to be realistic with your study schedule. I put a lot of schedule pressure on myself given the time lost through manhattan's class, putting me behind schedule.

1. The first is obvious, should I retake? I know higher score is always better, I am confident of getting Q50 with a bit more prep but bit worried if I can maintain the V40, should the time be used for other things instead? Better application prep, online courses etc.
2. If I should retake, what resources would be the best for me to get from 720 to 740+ in the next 1.5-2 months. As of now I am considering 1 or 2 months of TTP + Veritas 7 test pack. Info:

My study break lasted longer than expected because my industry was pretty badly hit by covid, and I had to focus my time and effort in the next few months on finding a new role. I was able to change jobs and spent the next 9 months on doing well in my new role. I finally feel that I have the bandwidth to start studying for the GMAT again. I’m also in much better place mentally than I had been last year when I was studying, so I hope it’ll have a positive impact on my performance this time. hope to take the GMAT again in 3-4 months time, given that the material isn’t super new to me. I’m hoping for a 720 with at least Q49 and V39+.  I’ve used so far:
- OG 2019, verbal and quant review 2019
- I used Jamboree’s resources and it helped me refresh my basics and introduce some tricks and shortcuts, but overall I don’t think it helped me hone my test taking ability to its fullest potential  
- For Verbal, I used Manhattan’s SC guide which helped me reach 94th percentile in the last exam, but RC and CR brought me down 
- I’d signed up for gmatclub’s quant tests (currently paused) but this was right before my break so I haven’t had a chance to use them yet  steps/help needed:

0,"Hey everyone, am planning to start studying for the GMAT around the 20th of June (a few days after I've finished my last exam at my current school). The large amount of different resources available makes me very unsure how I should go forth and which ones I should choose. I've been hearing a lot of good things about TTP, so I am leaning towards that, but I have also looked into the books by Manhattan Prep. I also get the impression that the OG guide is a must have, regardless of whether I choose to go with Manhattan or TTP.  am a first year undergraduate student who went straight to university after high school, and live in a non-English speaking country. Although the latter makes me worried the verbal part of the GMAT may turn out difficult, I have no problem understanding, reading, speaking or writing in english. Since I'm fresh out of high school I'd say my math is pretty good as well, although I honestly have no idea if it is any good relatively speaking, since I haven't had the chance to take the test yet. This summer I'll be working full-time from the 28th of June until around the 20th of August, and I am planning to take the test as soon as possible after I finish working (my next semester starts on the 23rd of August). Since I'm working full-time, I'll only be studying in the afternoon from around 4-5 PM until 9-10 PM (and more in the weekends). I've also been hearing that I should do the test once, to see where I'm at and what I need to improve on, before I even start to look at anything else. Do you have any recommendations for what I should go with? Manhattan or TTP? Or maybe something else? Does a good score (700+) seem realistic, given the time I have available? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! If you're wondering why I'm taking the test so early, it's because I would like to have a second and more prepared shot next summer incase things go badly.

Yes, i took way too much to study, but each one has his own reasons.
So, I took the practice exam an hour, I was scared to death, literally, my heartbeats were so high.
First, I finished TTP Quant with 73% accuracy.
For verbal, I used many material:e-gmat, Manhattan books, and gmat ninja videos.
I am quite confident that I can score at least 120 more points, I have good basics and my performance on official guide is supposed to be decent. think I got such score because I was very very stressed and the most important part is Time. ran out of time in both sections that I had to pause the exam, search for the question on google, and then submit my answers. am disappointed, but not totally, of my score, but at least I managed to overcome the fear of sitting for the exam.

0,"I remember these posts were extremely helpful during my prep, so I'd love to contribute right back! I've been studying for the GMAT for roughly 6 months, and throughout my prep, I've learned so much about the exam! Honestly, a part of me feels bittersweet about finishing the exam, given how much I mastered the material and how big a part of my life this exam was. That said, I'll dive right into the materials I used and my approach. I even really knew anything about the test (i.e. what a DS question is, how to approach SC's, etc.), I took a cold mock, GMAC Practice Test #1. I got a 650. Honestly, not a terrible start given that I didn't really understand much of anything, especially the format or timing of the test. However, my strengths and weaknesses were extremely clear after this test:  
**Strengths:**   
\-Critical Reasoning (got every single question correct)  
\-Algebra / anything that involved integers  
  
\-Sentence Correction  
\-Word Problems (took too long, was easily confused, etc.) Quant (8/10):**  
The regular guide is extremely introductory - get ready to go through what a fraction is. However, not having done any math in a few years, it was nice to review the basics. **The advanced guide is incredible though - a great guide to tackle challenging questions and gather the best approaches to difficult questions.**  Verbal (9/10):**   
Didn't use the whole thing, but from the sections I did use (primarily only SC), it was incredible. I became unbelievably efficient with sentence correction, often getting questions correct in &lt;40 seconds.   
 Ninja (10/10):**  
UNBELIEVABLE. Manhattan shaped my foundation for verbal, but GMAT Ninja really honed in the best methodology of approaching sentence correction. Unbelievable resource, and I think him endlessly for his services (all of which are free!!). Guide Questions (10/10):**  
This one is obvious, but still worth writing out. The original guide questions mimic the questions on the real exam. They're a must-do set. Remember - no third party test company comes close to the kind of questions the GMAT asks, **particularly for Verbal**.  a decent amount of practice, I thought I was ready for another practice test, so I gave mock test #2 a shot.  Practice Test #2 - 740 (Q50, V40).**   
I was ecstatic with this score, a near 100 point jump from my first attempt! At this point, I thought I was ready for my real test, given that my initial goal was 730+.  
 Test Attempt #1 (In-person) - 700 (Q48, V38)**  
Obviously a rather demoralizing attempt. The sad part is that I actually thought that I was doing quite well. The math was much trickier than the practices, but I thought the verbal was quite easy (felt rather comfortable on \~90% of the questions). I went home and just kicked my chair in frustration.  
 studying for 30 hours a week for three months straight, I took a much needed three-week break after my official attempt, getting back into the hang of things (seeing friends, getting back in the gym, partaking in my favorite activities, etc.). However, a part of me absolutely knew that my tenure with the GMAT wasn't over - I still had a lot of work in front of me. TTP (8.5/10):**  
After seeing the endless number of reviews for TTP, I had to give it a shot. I can say that it is a VERY elaborate and comprehensive program. However, given my skill level at the time (a Q48-50), I didn't utilize it properly. Regardless, I went through every chapter quickly and did a few Medium and Hard question sets along the way. I definitely picked up a few tricks and such going through the program, but at times, it felt as if the program was ridiculously detailed, so much so that it became overwhelming. If one is a beginner though, he/she should definitely consider this program (but keep in mind that you will need to sink a solid 4-5 months to get through the whole thing if completed properly).  
Also, keep in mind that there is a brief transition period from TTP questions to OG questions. The question types are VERY different - TTP is a lot more straightforward, whereas OG is much more nuanced. I vividly recall that after finishing my TTP stunt, I was doing horribly on the OG questions (even worse than before I had started TTP). Overall, it was rather demoralizing, seeing as I had sunk a good amount of time and expense into TTP. However, after a week or two of doing OG questions, I had my groove back.   TTP (6/10):**  
Personally, I wasn't a huge fan. It's not bad per sé, but it's hard to follow at times and it'll have you questioning whether you know what a noun is. The sentence correction chapters did have some very helpful tips, but it is VERY long and VERY detailed (which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on who the audience is). The questions were pretty bad though - I scored well on the chapter questions, but I thought they weren't even remotely similar to the OG questions.   
I checked out some of Critical Reasoning - it's pretty good, but again, some of the questions are absolutely ridiculous and have next to no resemblance to the real GMAT. With that said, I absolutely loved the Assumptions chapter.    it was time that I take another few practice exams.  
**GMAC Practice Test #3 - 750 (Q50, V41).**   
**GMAC Practice Test #4 - 780 (Q51, V46).** After this exam, I was in nirvana. Probably the happiest I've been in a long time. Please keep in mind that my quant score was probably a bit inflated, given that practice test 4 is generally considered easier than the real thing.  
 this point, I was ready. I knew that I had all the tools ready to be great. I rarely ever missed any questions because of foundational knowledge gaps, but rather because of silly mistakes, such as misreading the question, etc.  Test Attempt #2 (In-person) - 760 (Q50, V42).**   
Overall, felt very good during the math portion. I had some **VERY** tricky DS questions (I almost got fooled on several occasions), but given the strategies I had picked up from the Advanced Manhattan Guide, I was able to catch my mistakes before moving on. Towards the last 5-6 questions, I was getting absolutely ridiculously difficult questions (easily 95% rated on GMATClub), signaling that I was doing really well up to that point. In fact, my ESR shows that I got no questions wrong in the first 3 quarters of my test, and that all three of my mistakes came from the last quarter, unsurprisingly. Shame I wasn't able to snag that coveted Q51.   
Then, came the verbal. This section was **EXTREMELY** hard. Significantly harder than the last official exam and the practice exams. I was perplexed at how difficult and dense some of the reading comprehensive passages were. In fact, there was one passage that had \~30 words that I didn't understand, basically making the passage indecipherable (...for reference, I'm a native English speaker who reads a lot of books). Luckily, I had mastered SC at this point, so I didn't really struggle too much there (my ESR shows that I got every SC question correct) and CR questions weren't too bad given that the section is one of my biggest strong suits (got one CR question wrong, mostly from rushing towards the end). I'm saddened to say that I got four reading comprehensive questions wrong. **Four**. Yes, **four**. I'm still dumbfounded at that number.  overall, a veryyyy long journey, but a great, bittersweet ending. I'm happy to answer any questions you all have!","GMAT Experience - 760 (Q50, V42, 7IR, 6AWA) FINALLY DONE!",1622580862,16,1608,1

I spent a lot of time making and using flashcards, spent \~2 hours a day adding questions to my error log and redoing them, and spent a lot of time reviewing Manhattan Prep material from an earlier course (Interact videos, redoing problem sets, etc.). feel like I've lost a lot of steam and just can't imagine studying that hard again, and I feel like I've run out of material to an extent. For my retake, I'll be re-reviewing a lot of previously studied material and resetting previous CATs/OG mocks. Is that enough to bring my score to where I need it to be?

 accounting for 4-5 years.  Started studying for the GMAT in late October / early November mostly on weekends for around 10 - 12 hours a week. Aiming for a 710+.

Quant 34 (7 unanswered)  
 then I've been using TTP to get better on Quant which I do feel like has been helping as well as Manhattan prep / GMATNinja for Verbal.  I'm hoping to take the exam in July so I recently took another practice GMAT exam yesterday to see where I'm at now that I'm 90% way through TTP Quant and all the way through Manhattan Prep Verbal books. This is what I got:   
 610**  
IR 6   
Verbal 28 (4 unanswered, 1 hurried)   
Quant 44 (4 unanswered; although i started hurrying once i realized I had 10 minutes left to answer 10 questions).   
 as you can see my biggest issue is keeping on time. And this is something that's haunted me since high school and taking ACTs. I feel like if I'm able to answer those last 4 questions in each section that would raise my overall score by a great margin.   
I want to get your thoughts on how I can get faster? I have the Official Guide Wiley online platform, Manhattan Prep Questions, as well as TTP. Would you suggest me doing 10 questions using the Wiley platform and just focus on speed? Or 30 question practice tests at a time for Verbal and Quant? Let me know your thoughts.

0,"Just got back my GMAT Online score of 710 (Q47 V40). I was expecting 590 maybe. I felt like I was bombing the test from start to finish. The questions both in quant and in verbal felt orders of magnitude harder than any of the questions from the practice tests. Out of the 31 quant questions, I felt confident in around 10 of my answers. The verbal RC passages were so convoluted I guessed 3-4 questions, something I never did even once when practicing with LSAT passages.

0,"Hi Everyone, feel like I've overdone it on reviewing GMAT study plan/course recommendations. I was hoping to get some opinions on what I've mapped out as a possible approach \[course(s)\] I've identified, and side resources. Logically, I tried to identify a plan based on my weaknesses and my background. See below for some background on my main weakness (math).  Context**: Might be unnecessary, but figure it helps.... Due to some difficult life circumstances and also a bad experience/teacher with math in grade 9 (loved it before), I coasted through high-school math without really attempting to understand what was being taught and truly learn; rather, I just wanted to grind through and got good enough grades to go to university (nothing math-based). It's bothered me ever since that I never learned (10 years later - I have an undergraduate &amp; graduate degree - some basic stats work involved), and so recently decided to change that. Over the past 2.5 months I've taken a basic self-directed College Foundations math course (covered Fractions, Algebraic Manipulations, Solving Linear Equations, Factoring &amp; a bit of Probability). Nothing in-depth, but good basics and I enjoyed it/understood the vast majority of it. Also, I read geometry is a big topic on the GMAT, so I have just worked through almost all of Khan Academy's Geometry Basics so I'm not totally starting from scratch going into this. As for the other sections, they are more tailored to my strengths - they'll need lots of practice, but I'm not as concerned. Plan:**  outlined the above, my plan revolves around improving my math skills as I know that will be an issue early on (sounds pretty common). As a result, I bought the GMAT Foundations of Math (Manhattan Prep) book as a supplementary resource. This might have been premature, but it was on sale and had great review. Timeline** **Online Course:** ideally starting this week (May 17 - end of July)
* **GMAT:** aiming to write the test for first time end of July/early August, 2021.
* **Business School Applications:** Fall 2021 (late September/October) Prep Approach** **GMAT Practice Test** \- now that I've gotten some basics covered (math), I'm doing my first test this weekend to see how much work I really have to do. I was hoping to do this sooner, and before asking, but work has been hectic so I've fallen a little behind schedule. 
2. **GMAT Course** \- based on research and costs, I've been leaning towards Princeton Review, GMAT Whiz or TTP. I'm looking for a course that will explain the basics well. After lurking these forums, TTP seems highly recommended, whereas on GMAT Club, GMAT Whiz seemed appealing. Seeing as math is a concern, TTP may edge out the others.
3. **GMAT Club -** might be lost here, but it sounded like the GMAT Club resources (questions/error log/forum for support) are a good side resource to practice. Does this make sense, or is this literally the same thing I'd be getting from TTP/the math book? I liked the idea of the forum for support, but maybe that's unnecessary.
4. **GMAT Practice Test Schedule -** overwhelming amount of opinions on this, but something like the following is my tentative approach (minus the pre-course test this weekend): Test 1: 4 weeks into studying
* Test 2: 8 weeks in
* Test 3: 10 weeks in 
* Test 4: 11-12 weeks in (basically 1-week prior to test date) Resources/Recommended Changes?** Is there anything I'm missing or should include?

0,"Some background, I've been studying in 3-4 month intervals since August of 2019. My baseline was a 570 on a Manhattan Prep Exam. Aug 2019 to about March 2020, I studied using Manhattan prep books to learn the foundations. I felt that even though I understood the approaches to questions and the basic foundations as well as tracked questions in an error log and reviewed after each practice set, I wasn't really seeing an improvement after those 6-8 months, so I went with a private tutor for about 3 months from mid-March 2020 to mid-June 2020. I was consistently scoring a 650-660 on GMAC mocks with verbal always the laggard - score ranges were 47-49Q and Verbal 32-35V. I took the exam in person and scored a 600: 47Q, 26V, 6IR. I felt that this was accurate because I had very bad my time management on verbal and had to skip about 10 questions - I was also really anxious/nervous on verbal. I knew I needed to resolve a lot of verbal gaps and improve my reading speed. I ended up taking the summer off from studying and picked it up again at the end of August early September 2020.  watching GMATNinja SC videos I knew that there was a lot that I was missing. I ended up going with a verbal instructor, who was/is amazing, from GMATNinja and worked with that person from September to mid-October. My GMAC mock exams post-GMATNinja were 720, 760, 700, 700, 710. Ranging from Q48-51, V38-42. Job interviews for new job opportunities came up in November and December so I put GMAT on hold. Picked up studying again around Christmas and ended up getting Covid in mid-January, setting me back about a week. I began studying again start of February and felt ready so I took the Online GMAT Online in early March. Forgot to plug in my computer after showing the room to the tutor and my computer died half way through Verbal. I lost about 10 mins and skipped about 7 problems more or less in a row or every other to make up for lost time (I knew at that point that I was going to have to retake, but wanted to get test experience and see my score regardless). The quant score was very strange (6Q, which is not possible imho) - I think that my computer dying had something to do with this no counting the section or what, I'm not sure. My verbal score was 36V, which i was surprised at given the amount of non-strategic skipping. recently took the Online GMAT again about a week ago. I felt very prepared for both sections going in. I ended up getting a 600: 47Q, 26V, 7IR - the same exact score as last July and basically the same exact breakdown. I do not understand this at all. Timing on both sections was good and didn't feel rushed - far better than the performance in July. I only skipped like 1-2 on each section but spaced them out. I really don't understand how a 26V is possible, that would mean I got like 15 or more questions wrong, and I think that there's just no way that that happened. ESRs are not available for Online GMAT, so I contacted GMAC about the score and am waiting to hear back. The plan is to apply R1, but based on my goal and targets, it would be a waste of time to apply with anything under a 700 (White American male, more or less traditional background). I plan to retake in person. I wonder if it's an Online GMAT thing. Has anyone else experienced this much of a discrepancy between GMAC mocks and the actual GMAT?

0,"Hey guys. So I began studying for the GMAT in October but honestly I was not diligent at all. Started with a MGMAT score of 620 (Q42, V34 - might be slightly off but something like this).   
 first official mock in early March and got 620 again (Q45, V31) after 3 modules of TTP (yes, only 3. I've been very lazy) - but even then I could tell that I was more confident with quant thanks to TTP. Since then I haven't done much TTP even though I have paid for it. Fast forward to test date approaching (took this monday) I became desperate and tried to cram which obviously did not work out but I did manage to get my highest test score (640). I am not happy with this and I am due to take the test again on May 14. As crazy as it might sound, I think my score increase in V came from focusing on OG Verbal questions in the last week (mentioned a lot here, big mistake from the beginning). I neglected quant so I understand why it dipped.   
 anyone have any tips on how I should prioritize? Should I go through select TTP chapters on topics I'm not so good at and ace those while also doing OG problems? That was another mistake I made - when I was practicing I mainly used manhattan material which IMO is not really good. I have only done like 4% of the OG problems and only recently started using the efficient wiley website (smh, yes I know I am an idiot for this). retaking exam in two weeks. started at baseline of \~620 and have been stuck there since (my fault for not studying).

I messaged the TTP team and received a study plan to work on accordingly.  only a week of the study program, I finally received a 700 (Q49, V36) on my second practice test. I genuinely thought I was failing verbal but in reality.... I got the first 14/15 questions right. I used Manhattan’s time management lesson on how to break down each section in regards to time management. It worked like a charm. My goal now is to use OG questions as a real test like conditions. I would take 30 Quant questions and 36 Verbal questions and review afterwards. I’m trying to build stamina throughout the test and battle fatigue. I know I can hit a 730+.

0,"I recently scored 730(Q50,V39) but I was always confused about which prep material is best for me and I'd always question whether or not it would take me to 700+. I ended up using trials of literally everything on the market and **purchased Magoosh, Target Test Prep (TTP), and E-GMAT (verbal)**. MAGOOSH  Best for native speakers who are clear with their quant basics.
* Magoosh doesn't go deep when it comes to explaining concepts. As I am non native speaker, doing their verbal didn't help me much as I was never clear with even the most basic concepts. 
* Magoosh quant is good for those who are clear with basics as it provides a sort of summary about quant concepts. However, if you aren't clear with basic algebra, arithmetic, geometry, etc, Magoosh will only be a waste of your time. 
* For those looking to save money during prep, this is the course for you. One of the cheapest courses but the best in that price range. Nevertheless, I request that you get the best course and not settle for less if according to your needs, you need some costly course. You are going to spend a ton of money on applications and tuition fee so saving $400-500 on courses might just jeopardize your career. 
* Can finish quant and verbal videos in 2-3 months. TARGET TEST PREP (TTP)  The best course for those who are weak in quant. 
* TTP is famous for getting most of its students to that Q48-50 range. How do they do that? They drill you on every concept that you need to know to perform on the GMAT. You'll get these amazing notes on every concept and can note it down in your notebook or highlight them on the TTP platform for summarizing. If you haven't gone through quant or you were never good at quant then my friend, TTP is your savior. 
* I won't hype up their verbal course because I didn't use it much but it is decent. Their verbal easy questions feel like 700+ GMAT so I avoided doing those. Their verbal course is new but considering their standards for quant, I'm sure their verbal is great as well. 
* You need 5-6 months just to finish their quant course. Unfortunately, perfection comes at a price. Due to the fact that they try to ensure a high quant score, they make you do a ton of exercises which can be time consuming. But I guess you need to struggle in order to get that Q50.  E-GMAT (VERBAL)  I cannot stress this enough. My fellow brothers and sisters of the Indian subcontinent, get E-GMAT. It is customized for non native speakers i.e., yes, the basics. You need to be spot on with your basics to cross the V35 wall. 
* They explain everything with these amazing examples. They'll first explain a certain noun or verb and then give you an example to help you understand how the game of GMAT works. Their SC course is probably the best SC course on the market. Native speakers, if you're struggling with SC, go ahead and get E-GMAT SC. 
* Do not buy their quant and do not use their mocks. I haven't been to hell but if hell does exist, it looks like E-GMAT quant. Horrible questions and horrible explanations. Save your money and buy something else for quant. The worst quant prep material. 
* You need 2-3 months just to get through their verbal.  MANHATTAN (BOOKS)  I had to return them since preparing from books isn't for me but I'll still give my review. 
* From what I read and what I have been told about these books, they are the best if you are looking to prepare from books.
* Should take you 3-4 months, maybe even more to finish these books. 
* They are costly, yes, but get these books and you won't need anything else. They have everything. GMAT OG Bundle  Amazing books but why buy when you can get those questions with even better explanations on GMAT Club Forum. 
* If you did purchase these books then stop what you're doing, visit [ and activate your book codes to use their online software. Create your own sets as per your own needs to get the best out of those questions. 
* Please note that there won't be much difference between the latest edition and the previous year's edition. Only a few questions are added each year to each book so don't buy the new one. But if you have an old edition such as 2016 or 2017 then go ahead and buy the 2021 or 2022 edition.  GMAT NINJA  Even if you are new to GMAT prep, you already know this legend. He is a GMAT God and should be taken seriously. 
* His YouTube video on the GMAT Club Forum channel were quite helpful. He doesn't explain the basics but you get to understand his thought process and use it for yourself. 
* I used his SC and CR videos and I'm glad I did. They provided me with a lot of clarity and helped me set the perfect mindset for myself to solve those verbal questions. 
* Also, go through his blogs [ in which he explains many important things about how to prepare and what to focus on.  MOCKS  I'll keep this short and sweet because I don't want to type more. 
* Official mocks are considered the best mocks but not for me. They are outdated. Their scoring algorithm is spot on for verbal and so are their questions but their quant questions are outdated and easy. You will not get such easy questions on the real thing so if you are getting Q50 on official mocks then just assume you are at Q47.
* Manhattan mocks are good for those aiming for Q50 but they're quite demotivating. Trust me, you'll get demotivated when you score 700 on official mocks but 600-630 on Manhattan mocks.
* Kaplan mocks are the best, in my arrogant opinion. Their quant questions seemed a little tough but their scoring algorithm is the most accurate. 
* Veritas mocks are somewhat similar to Manhattan mocks in terms of difficulty so that should answer your queries. 
* GMAT Club Forum mocks are great for those aiming for that Q51. I haven't seen anything this tough since my CAT prep (Indian entrance exam).  PLEASE NOTE: I have not been paid to write these reviews. I have seen negative comments about TTP and E-GMAT, stating that many reviews on reddit and GMAT Club Forum are fake. I can assure you that I wasn't paid a single rupee by any company. Trust me, I'd love to take their money since COVID has hurt my family financially but no, I wasn't paid for this. 
* GMAT is no joke. Pleased don't ask how you can go from 500 to 700 because it is almost impossible. I'm sorry but someone had to say it. 
* GMAT quant is evolving. Ask anyone who gave GMAT recently and most of them will tell you that GMAT questions are different now. They might not be hard but they are different. 
* Please focus on your basics. As Elvis once said, ""only fools rush in"". 
* There is no ""best course"". Every course is amazing but it just might not be a good fit for you.
* Also, I apologize if my statements seemed arrogant. I know I might be wrong but I just shared my honest opinions.
* DM me if you need any help.

0,"I’ve taken the GMAT 3 times now (all in person) and am pretty unhappy with the scores. First attempt I felt the quant was much harder than the practice tests, and I ended up with 680 (Q43 / V40). I took it again about 6 weeks later and scored 700 (Q44 / V 41). I took it again yesterday and was devastated to see a 680 (Q45/V38) again after focusing on quant for about 25 hours a week for the last 2 months. I have really bad test anxiety and each time I’ve walked out of the quant section knowing I messed up a few easier questions that I should have gotten right.  taken 5 out of the 6 official mocks with scores around 680-700 each time. This worries me that my score will never get higher than this, but I’ve gotten Q 47-48 a few times and up to V 44, but not on the same test. I took the official quant practice a few days before my last attempt which gave me a score estimate of 47-51 on quant, which I was happy with. My scores on the actual exams though have been substantially worse though.  this point, I’m exhausted from putting in 20+ hours a week while working long hours and am really unhappy about the idea of applying with a 700, but am getting worried that my attempts (since you can only take it 5x in a year) are running out. While I know 700 in the grand scheme of things isn’t a bad score, I’m not going to be happy personally with anything less than 720-730 but I really doubt my ability to get there at this point.  prep, I did the full Manhattan course, studied on my own for about 4 months after that and then started using TTP for the last 2 months to try and really improve quant.

Kindly refrain from doing hard(700+) questions if you haven't reached 80-90% on easy and medium level questions.

I pretty much did TTP and then did the OG 2020. I took the test without doing any mock tests.  my first exam, I realized that my weaknesses were work, ratios, and remainder questions. I also knew that I had to improve on permutation &amp; combination even though I didn't say a lot of those question types. I took a break for a month or two after taking the exam in July 2020 because I decided not to apply that round so I figured I had some time. for Exam 2**
I reviewed my weak areas mentioned above. I started doing GMATClub 700-800 level questions and kept an error log which I would review frequently. I reviewed Flashcards that I made during TTP review for basic rules and patterns (ex. even + even = even, remainders of divisor n are integers from 0 to n-1). For Verbal, I did TTP verbal for CR and SC. I got a majority of CR wrong but continued to redo them until I at least was able to put the argument and line of reasoning in my words. I was ok at SC but relying on my ear at that time. I made Verbal flashcards for rules I usually forgot and some idioms that sound wrong but are in fact correct. My study cadence was timed 10Q questions in the morning before work and timed 10V questions (or go through TTP Verbal lessons) after work on weekdays. On weekends, I would deep-dive into a Quant topic, review error logs, and redo problems (probably 2-3 hours each day). I usually didn't do any verbal practice on weekends. I did some questions in the OG 2020 and 2021 before taking the exam in January 2021. I did not do any practice tests in preparation for the exam.  for Exam 3**
I purchased an ESR after this exam and finally opened the GMAT Official Advanced Questions booklet. I began going through some of the Quant questions in sections that I did poorly in according to the ESR. I did a few more deep-dives on remainders, ratios, and word problems using TTP for foundational knowledge then using a combination of TTP and GMATClub for question practice. I took a GMAT Official Practice test and got a 730 (Q49 V41)
While I was analyzing the Verbal section in the ESR and the GMAT Official Practice Test, I realized that I'm not as good at SC as I thought I was. So, I watched the GMAT Ninja SC playlist (2 videos every weekend for a month). This really changed my approach to SC. I went from relying on my ear to a very mechanical approach (eliminating choices with any glaring grammatical errors, analyzing meaning). My percent correct on advanced questions went up and I was answering hard questions correctly more often. I continued with the cadence of 10Q questions every morning from either TTP or official prep and 10V questions every evening from official guide and official advanced questions. My approach to RC became to slow down so that I understood the passage, take notes, and when I read the questions, really analyze the options (ex. is the passage analyzing or comparing options). This slowed me down a little but I felt my SC got faster so it balanced out. I did not do anything for CR besides answering and reviewing official questions because I felt like I was not making better despite TTP and skimming Manhattan Prep All the Verbal CR section. I took another GMAT Official Practice test after learning GMAT Ninja SC approach and got a 740 (Q49, V42). 2 weeks later, I took the actual exam. In those 2 weeks, I continued to do/re-do hard OG &amp; GMAT Official Advanced questions and reviewed flashcards. Day**
Woke up at 5.30 and got ready. I got a good nights sleep but still felt nervous as soon as I got up. I did a few exercises to get the blood pumping. I also did 2 practice Quant questions from the Official Practice and reviewed them quickly. I started with Quant and honestly I let my training take over. I felt I was able to think through questions clearly. There weren't any surprising, never before seen type questions. I even caught myself on 2 DS questions making a logical error (I realized this was an issue during my prep so I was extra aware of it). This time I didn't manage my time as well as the other times I took the exam. I got to the last questions with ~30s and only had time to read it. I knew how to do it but just didn't have time to solve it so just had to guess. Verbal was fine and again I let my training take over on SC. SC definitely got harder as I progressed but I was able to reason through it by focusing on meaning of the sentence. RC was fine and I definitely took longer on reading passages and answer RC questions. CR questions were tricky but I did my best and moved on since I didn't want to spend too much time on something that isn't my strength. Again, I didn't do a great job of managing my time and had to guess on the last 2 questions.  Thoughts**
For Quant, I think I was able to really drill down on my weak areas with ESR and then focus on them through the Advanced Questions booklet. I was making some stupid mistakes on medium questions so I became super conscious of those after test 1. Between test 2 and test 3, I focused on hard quant questions. I think GMAT Ninja SC is to Verbal SC what TTP is to Quant. It really established my approach to SC. Thanks to this sub for motivation and guidance!","Debrief - 750 (Q49, V44)",1617827423,8,1157,1

0,"Hi,
I need some advice on what I should do based on my gmat prep scores. started to consider the option of going to grad school in January. My top choice school has a fall deadline of 5/1 to apply.
I took a cold test, late January (I did some light practice questions just to get the feel first but it was basically cold and I have been out of undergrad for 2 years)
I scored a 510. range at the school is 560-720. The rest of my application honestly is good (graduated with honors at another top business school in undergrad) so I was hoping to shoot for about 620ish, preferably higher. been spending a fair amount of time studying (trying about an hour a day, some days I don’t study and weekends I try to do more as I work full time) I have a collection of apps (ready for gmat, Kaplan, as well as the official guide and some Flashcards, as well as the Manhattan prep practice tests/resources). did another practice test (Manhattan prep ones) and I got ... another 510. Quant improved (not a lot) and verbal decreased a tad. But pretty similar numbers.
I just feel so discouraged now, I have my test date scheduled for 4/2.... as I wanted my score before submitting my application. I just feel like if I do take it I doubt i will do well based on those scores. I thought about taking it and maybe I’ll do better than I expect but I just don’t know.  don’t know how I didn’t improve, I felt incredibly more confident with my answers this time. I’m thinking I got lucky the first time and guessed INCREDIBLY well so my real score would’ve been lower based on what I do know.  wanted to get in for fall, I have some other schools im interested in that have later deadlines, so I’m sure if I rescheduled I could maybe get in one of those schools with a reschedule. But the top choice if I reschedule I would have to wait until spring. thoughts? I just feel like I will do so poorly it would be a waste of time at this point that soon and I won’t have a decent score for any school.",Should I reschedule?

0,"Just said I would post the resources that I used through my GMAT prep (total study time of 4 weeks to first attempt, then 2 weeks to my second attempt). of the resources have all been mentioned in previous posts, which were a huge help to me, but hopefully this might help someone in a similar situation! Exams:
Cold ( cold meaning I hadn’t revised any material/techniques and just tried an exam..) 680 (49 quant, 30s for Verbal) | 750 (49q,42v) | 730 (48q,42v) | 700 (48q,38v) | 730 (49q,40v) | 760 (49q,46v) | attempt: 730 (47q,42v)... Then booked another online exam for 16 days after, and did one more practice exam (740-49q,42v). attempt: 740 (49q, 41v) approach: I come from a maths background (undergrad degree), so wrongly assumed from my initial test to focus the vast majority of my time on verbal (specifically SC). I spent 2 hours a day on SC and 1 hour a day on quant ( will go through resources below). After my first real exam, I switched my focus and did ~3 hours of maths a day, while spending maybe half an hour tipping away at SC.  was strong on RC and CR so didn’t do much study on these.
 Resources:
Started by reading through the SC part of the Manhattan prep verbal guide. If you are a native English speaker, I wouldn’t bother learning all the grammatical terms etc. Focus on the rules that they state, and keep note of these along the way. also read the RC part of this guide - and would recommend this for strategy.  purchased the official guides and questions sets for verbal, and began taking the SC questions of these online (sets of 20). I looked up any that I got wrong/flagged, trying to understand the reason. Again, I added to my list of SC rules as I went through this. the end of my prep I looked through GMAT ninjas YouTube videos on SC - I would recommend doing this earlier. He will focus in on the actual rules needed for the SC part of the exam, and how to apply them. I was working through the official guide question banks all this time. By the end of your studies, I think you should have a list of 15 or so rules for SC, ordered in importance.


Again, if I were to start again I would focus a lot more on this. I got a sub to Target Test Prep, but didn’t really give enough time to it before my first exam to see any difference. About 80% of the material on the gmat had been thought to me at high school level, but 20% (particularly prime numbers and divisibility) had not. Instead of focusing on these weak areas, I just spent my time doing random quant official guide questions, and just working through TTP in order. my first exam, my approach changed. I went through TTP solely on the areas were I knew I was weak, and also purchased the GMAT Club tests. I tried every hard question for each of these topics, and began to see improvements. Overall, I don’t think my prep for this part of the exam was the best.
If I had one advice for someone in a similar situation as me for quant (ie. high 40s baseline, relatively short time to prepare) : FOCUS ON YOUR WEAKNESSES. Obviously no one likes doing this, but it is where you’ll see most improvement in your results.

* 3 months of studying. 1 month of OG, 1 month of Manhattan Advanced Quant, then 1 month of OG Verbal + Quant Review (the slim extra books).  
* Took all 6 official mocks, average score of 760 (Q50-51, V43-46).  
* Took 4 MGMAT mocks.  I thought Quant was incredibly difficult on MGMAT.  Average score was 690 (Q45 V36 ish).  Note on Manhattan - it's a great way to experience very difficult Quant questions.  But the practice tests really are very difficult, and the scores aren't necessarily representative. Debrief:**
* I thought Quant was incredibly difficult.  Like MGMAT difficult.  I ended up having something like 14 minutes for the last 10 questions.  I read many threads here where people thought online GMAT was harder, so maybe that is true.  However, my score (Q49) shows that I did (much) better than I expected.  I literally thought I had bombed this portion, so perhaps the curve is a little gentler as well.
* After being surprised at my decent Quant, I was likewise surprised at my weak Verbal.  Verbal was always a 50-50 section for me, I'm never fully confident in my answers in the same way I might be for Quant, but I haven't experienced a score that low in any of my official mocks except perhaps 1 of them.
* Not having a break between Quant and Verbal really, really threw me off my game.  The only thing I remember about Verbal is that I literally wanted to sleep, I was so exhausted already. for some advice:**
* My goal is a 760.  Based on my mocks, I believe I can achieve it.  However, I'm not sure where to go from here.  Where are the best places to practice 700+ level questions?  I feel like OG materials are not difficult enough compared to what I experienced on the test.  Saw the most complicated SC question of my life during my exam.
* I specifically am looking to avoid AWA (have spent 0 hours on it), so I'm debating if I should take the online again before April 8.  If not, then I guess I would want to try in-person, although wearing a mask during the exam sounds stressful. advice/encouragement/criticism you have is welcome!

I’m scheduled to take the GMAT on May 30th and hopefully, it’ll be my last.  GMAT journey started in November 2019 when I took my first practice test and scored a cold 550. Squarely average, but a long shot from my target goal of 720. I began seriously studying in Jan. 2020 and tried my best to make a reasonable schedule to follow using a combination of OG materials and Manhattan Prep. Unfortunately, I lacked a lot of baseline knowledge and had to spend more time than anticipated to build my foundation. Add the fact that my job has long hours and an unpredictable schedule and I quickly fell behind my study plan and stopped actively studying around Mid Feb.  didn’t study much until July 2020. After seeing some friends have success with TTP, I decided to give it a try and it has been the best part of my journey so far. The way it teaches quant is unparalleled.  It took a lot of time and I was on and off, but the progress could definitely be seen. I took the GMAT in Nov. and scored a 590. Not the improvement I was looking for, but progress was made. After that, I took some time off work and decided to get serious about studying. I did my best to run through as much of TTP as I possibly could while not rushing and it was worth it. I was able to improve from Q37 to Q45 between tests. I was seeing progress. continued studying into 2021 but had to return to work and started running into inconsistency issues. My on and off again schedule was impacting my score and I dropped 60 points between practice tests which really spooked me and that is what brought me here.  scheduled to take the GMAT on May 30th. Currently, I’ve completed all TTP quant lessons except Coordinate Geometry, Functions and Sequences, and Strategy. I’ve also completed all TTP SC sections and I am working on the Critical Reasoning Section now.  have the following questions for the community: How should I structure my time for the next three months? My plan right now is to practice quant problems and finish learning verbal for the first month and take a practice test to gauge my progress. From there, I plan to drill questions each week and take practice tests every 3 weeks leading up to my test date. Does that make sense?
* Is there a better verbal resource to use? I’ve used TTP Verbal for most of my studying and it has been a slog. I found the critical reasoning to be good, but I’m still struggling with SC. I’ve watched a few NinjaGMAT videos as well, but I haven't committed to it. English is my first language but I was raised in a multi-lingual household and have gaps in foundational grammar skills.

0,"Hi guys. Just finished my online exam on Feb.13, got 700 (Q48/V38, IR4); here is few points on my personal experience.  issues..technical issues. On second quant question I’ve got popped up message saying that there is reconnection (???). Then my exam screen was lost and another one popped up promising that proctor will resume my exam soon. After 5-10 min of waiting I got a bit unease. No proctor. Another 5 min passed and I tried to attract attention by waving hands to camera and talking out loud. Nothing. Another 5 min, I started literally shouting. After that a proctor opened a chat and asked not to mumble (!!!)😂 I said, well, I would not but please resume my exam. Guy did not reply anything and I waited another 15 min. After that exam was resumed. Well, if you are kind of nervous type of person, you might think ahead how to keep cool if thing like that happens; was hard. First 5-10 questions were really hard, then difficulty became manageable. I know it is very subjective but to give you a feeling, first 5-10 question s are more like MGMAT 700+ questions rather than those in GMAT prep. I’ve got 3(!) probability/combinatorics problems with several twists, while in GMAT prep I barely saw 1 problem of this topic per test. Having gone through quant I though that I was a complete idiot. However, retrospectively it seems that algorithm in my online exam just did not work, shooting hard questions first and then moving to more solvable ones. Anyway, the takeaway here - don’t panic early, just go through the section and don’t waste your time on first 5-7 questions if they feel too difficult. 
Apart of that I think it is important to say that I scored consistently Q42-45 in MGMAT and Q49 in GMAT prep- not a genius, but not a complete dumb*ss; was a bit different than in GMAT prep. SC was a bit strange. For example, I had couple of sentences that emulated kind of internal email exchange. Given that most of us get used to dealing with SC taken from scientific articles or kind of “official” reports, those sentences seemed really weird. CR was harder than GMAT prep for sure. Most were on evaluation, assumption, and strengthen. Did not have boldface. Few questions contained kind of proportion / percentage mix, stuff that I really don’t like😂 Reading was more or less in line, nothing extraordinary; is where I started sweating. Even though I did not give a sh*t to IR, still I planned to score at least 5-6. Well, no way.

I had an exam date scheduled, but it kept getting pushed back due to COVID. Eventually, I decided to hold off on the GMAT and focus on career-related matters until my long term plans became more clear.

I thought I could alleviate some of that anxiety by sharing my collective experience. GMAT, it is definitely one of the most important exams of your career. I dedicated a big chunk of time to prepare for this beast, and you should do so yourself. The key to this exam is understanding. Understanding is more important than the exact resources you will use or how many times you have gone over shelf assessments . In brief, my strategy was to first go over each topic in Official Guide once, using additional resources to help me understand the basic principles. Also, I studied Manhattan GMAT Advanced Quant and it helped a lot to practice with problem solving, which is the most important factor to do well on the exam. Then, doing GMAT official tests, always in timed mode. Seems pretty standard, right? Well, I got a 700 just by studying smart. And I can teach you how to do that! while you are preparing for the GMAT you are going to feel lost and desperate. Trust me, those feelings are totally normal. You can easily get lost trying to figure out what information is important and what not, what are the right algorithms to find the right answer, or how to organize your study plan….

0,"I'm posting this as a guide to
- the online exam experience
- my prep and my circumstance/situation
- few general tips I recently posted [this]( after my first online exam had a technical error within the first half an hour. After lots of unnecessary stress from the terrible customer service at Pearson Vue, I eventually managed to get a rescheduled exam booked for the 4th Jan. This exam went through pretty much all fine bar the proctors chiming in every now and then, as well as my webcam showed a black screen yet the proctor check in assured me the camera could see me. the results appeared 6th Jan so super quick after completing the exam (if it matters I'm based in the UK). managed to bag a 710, Q49 V38 IR8 on my first try which is not a brag but I'm just super happy the stressful period is over. The exam prep was very grueling and I have to say it's a tough ride, but after scoring that I'm relieved more than anything. I know compared to some of the posts on here that score isn't special and some want to achieve higher, but trust me after the real hard graft put in I'm super stoked with my score. In addition I believe a lot of the posts on here score wise are skewed so you believe 700s are run of the mill.... The percentiles are there for a reason... it was your classic minimum 8 hour work days followed by a light relax of about an hour, then finishing the day off with a few hours of GMAT. This routine was continuous for 6 months. I started around late July/August, however I began my journey around Feb/March wanting to get into the GMAT by talking to some acquaintances and buying the OG and Manhattan guides... Like I said though, I properly got started around late July/August so a 6 month journey. was like most cases here wanting to achieve a 700 in 2 months prep from cold. I wanted to apply R1 in late September (for my schools) so thought 2 months was more than enough, a slightly skewed perception based on things I read here and elsewhere online. If you can do that in 2 months from cold, you're somewhat gifted. You are either a natural standardised tester, a regular reader and are naturally good at gmat verbal, or are just simply super smart 0.0001% able to pick things up super quick and apply things easily. process does take time and I was somewhat lucky I managed to get my score on my first try. I was prepared to take it again had it been necessary. simply addressing the materials I used... Initially manhattan guides (which are good but I don't really do learn by reading over and over). I got the manhattan guides because of the relative inexpensive price tag, comparative to other materials. Like I said they are good just not my cup of tea. I also got the OG guides, the physical copies of which I barely used. I absolutely rinsed to pieces the online question bank you are given. a little deliberation and research I secured to go for TTP 4 months and in terms of concepts TTP is literally amazing. Cannot give it more props. I really thought the Quant was great and the SC stacked up too. The CR was so so but I didn't really use it. I think CR and RC are very difficult to teach/learn and that by simply reading more you'll get better (which I didn't do because improvement in reading skills takes more than a few months, even a few years...) One thing I have to say about TTP was that while the questions are great art reinforcing the concepts from a base level I don't think they really stack up against OG questions. They are very obvious as to what topic is being tested and the way they are set out is not the same as the official questions. The chapter tests are great and I thoroughly recommend them, I just don't recommend using the questions from TTP to really practice test questions. also REALLY recommend the GMAT Ninja videos on YouTube through GMAT club. Charles is a beast and is fantastic as helping with verbal, especially SC. They're a must. a few general tips: Use the OG question bank to practice. Once I got my concepts down in both q and v I just smashed our og questions. 10 at a time or so building up but almost everyday doing 10-20 questions here or there, splitting between quant and verbal. GMAT club question of the day is really good. Gets your brain to do gmat work even when ""relaxing"" and actually I didn't break out of rest phases. Split your time wisely over your weaknesses, which is obvious. But don't neglect your strengths, these are your strengths you can't afford to drop questions with those topics, keep those ticking too. Plan your test well in advance. As you may read from my other post there can be ludicrous setbacks which impact your whole application process, don't let it happen to you.

I'm wondering how accurate my performance will be / if I'll remember the questions / if the questions will repeat Are the two free MBA.com tests truly adaptive? I just did the first free exam and the first half of each Q and V was easy but the second half of each was hard. How indicative is MBA.com's test of true performance. I had timing issues and randomly guessed on 4 questions on each of the sections at the end to avoid having 4 unanswered questions. I ended up getting a 690. Kind of surprised tbh. Some questions seemed kind of familiar - i may have seen them back in 2017 or on GMAT Club so I'm not sure what to take away from my current performance.",MBA.com and MGMAT CATs,1610226957,4,205,1
0,"Hi Folks,  have a table with all my tests and study materials inserted below if you want to skip the long story.

 TL&amp;DR 520--&gt;740 in 4 months, with TTP for the last 2 months. Yes, worth it, etc etc. Just do it.  been lurking here for the past few months and I'm excited to finally be able to share what worked for me. Typical of me to always do things at the last minute. I took a blinded practice test in mid-August but wasn't fully committed to studying until Sept. 1st. My final exam was on Dec 30th, so I spent a full 4 months prepping for the GMAT. There is a reason they tell you to study for 6 months. Had I started earlier, I think I would have gotten a better score, but I'm applying now to R2 for part time programs, so it is what it is.  started studying with the OG practice questions, Kaplan 800, and online tips and tricks and got an ""okay"" score (640/Q39/V39 ) in September. I know PT is less competitive, but I have an abysmal GPA, and I was explicitly told that I would not be considered for top programs unless I was able to hit 700. So that's why I couldn't stop there.  was getting killed by quant, so I purchased the Manhattan Prep Materials as well as got a copy of the GMAT bible from a friend and finished all of them before my next test in October (650/Q37/V42). Yikes, right??  the existential crisis and trying to figure out how to really improve my quant score. I didn't have time or 3k for a full on prep course. I know error tracking is key for identifying weak subjects and overall improvement, but what do you do when you are well rounded in weakness? The other problem was that it took several hours to even put together my first spreadsheet, and took valuable time to track and update that could be spent reviewing material. I saw that TTP had a flexible monthly payment option and started the course on October 25th.  was a game changer. Not only is it worth paying for someone else to keep track of your errors, but also the asynchronous ""do it on your own time"" style of review available was great for me, because I have a full time job and little time to study during normal hours. They do a great job of using the same style of word problems and question formulation as the OG material (which I reviewed in its entirety after completing most of the TTP course, 2 weeks before my final exam). What made the biggest difference was slowing down and giving myself the time to watch the video explanations of the medium/hard questions, EVEN if I got them correct, because having that extra audio explanation really cemented the hard concepts, and sometimes I could learn a faster way to answer the question that I hadn't considered earlier.  a shame that their verbal prep, which is still in beta, is not yet complete. The videos ARE KEY to understanding SC and CR. It was just hilarious how awful he made the wrong answers in SC sound when he read them out loud (and they just seem so much more obvious that way) and I actually looked forward to SC on my practice and official exams. I had to muffle a giggle or two during the final exam as I was reading them in his voice in my own head. The CR review was hands down instrumental to my improvement. On my final practice test I didn't get a single one incorrect, and 85% of the hard OG practice questions. Getting through the CR first helped improve my performance on RC, especially the inference questions. I used no extra material to prep for RC besides the small sections in the Kaplan 800, Foundations of Verbal, and reading through the OG practice questions.  maybe would have broken that 700 in November (670/Q40/V42), but I was dealing with a death in the family that month, and the SF site moved to a different location WITH THE SAME DAMN STREET NUMBER, and I had to run 20 blocks to make it to the exam on time.  I did arrive on time but then had to stave off a panic attack in the bathroom. So...not an optimal test day for me.  was spent studying and avoiding COVID, because, god forbid I have to cancel my last exam because I'm fucking quarantined. I had a week off before the final exam (studying on Christmas) and was able to fully focus on reviewing TTP material, as well as practicing all the OG questions to get used to the format (the hard OG geometry, stats, and probability is a worded a little bit trickier than TTP.)  typically do well under stress, so the GMAT was my first experience really struggling with test day anxiety and the pressure to get a 700. Making sure that I took the last 3 practice exams in their entirety during this last month of prep helped me overcome this. I also changed the order that I took the test sections. I was told that you should do the hardest section first so that you aren't fatigued, but in December, switching over to AWA/IR/QUANT/VERBAL helped me warm up a bit and get into the right mental state before tackling the Quant section. I took all my practice tests at the same time as my final test, and I also made sure to schedule my final exam in the same location that I have been before so that the stress of being lost would not be a factor on test day. Also, no caffeine after 12 pm.  official score was 740/Q48/V44/AWA 6/IR 8 of the story: reviewing material is important, but getting over your own mental obstacles might be just what you need to get you over that hump! I can do it, you can too!!!

 read so many of these over the past six months. It's wild to finally be writing one. was not easy. I knew it would be hard, but I did not expect it to consume six months of my life the way that it did. On that note, if you're reading this and haven't jumped in yet, JUST DO IT. I wasted so much time my first month fumbling through the official guide and making every excuse I could not to just take that first practice test and start on a linear study program. Take the damn practice test and then pick your program. scored a 640 (41Q/36V) cold. I was pleasantly surprised, and it really opened my eyes to just how much this test will mess with your head. I remember going blind halfway through the quant section and just randomly picking answers. I knew I had a lot of work to do, but I felt good about where I was starting. signed up for TTP because they had the month-long free trial and I really liked the interface and analytics platform. I started out with both Quant and Verbal but when I realized how long it was going to take, I switched to just Quant because I felt okay-ish about my cold verbal score. I slowly worked my way through the Manhattan ""All the Verbal"" book from front to back, which was a decent primer. In retrospect, it was not enough. I'll get to that in a minute. back to that timing thing, TTP takes *forever* on the expert track. I started in August and had a test scheduled for November 7th. I ended up pushing my test to December 19th when I realized I wasn't going to be through the program in time. This is all the more reason not to screw around and just jump in. finished TTP with about 3 weeks left before my test. I took practice test 1 over again, and then cooked through the rest of them. These were my scores: (47Q/39V) (49Q/39V) (49Q/41V) (47Q/37V) (42Q/42V) (49Q/42V) through the practice tests is when the mental component of this stuff really started to kick in. I was totally [burning myself out]( I was studying late into the night every night and waking up early to study more. I felt like I was kind of losing my mind. I was feeling really good after that 750. Then I went in for my first real test: (44Q/37V) was a bad day. And the thing, I still can't tell you what happened. I went home and hit the books again, watched a bunch of GMAT Ninja videos and redid some weak areas on TTP. I took the online test a few days later and waited for the scores to come in: (46Q/37V) still wasn't happy. I wanted a 47 quant, and I knew I could do it, but my bigger question was...why couldn't I get that verbal score above a 40? I had to wait two weeks before my next test, which ended up being a blessing. I decided *not* to study like crazy. I was going to devote an hour to each section per day and would cut myself off. I also started meditating daily (Headspace is a great app). Also...I *finally* went back to TTP verbal after [Marty]( kindly pointed me to a few key chapters. Turns out, the program is amazing. If you have the time to commit, I'm confident that if you cooked through the entire TTP program for both quant and verbal, you'd be unstoppable. anyway, I took the test a few hours ago and finally nailed it. I know a lot of people don't have the money to machine-gun three tests in a row like I did. And with that, I'm gonna say something that might be kind of unpopular: I think this test is kind of a crap shoot. The first time I went in, I did everything the forums said. I ate well, exercised, didn't study for 48 hours before the test, got lots of sleep...and I still bombed it. Today, I felt like garbage. I slept terribly last night and have been having an extremely stressful work week. Yes, TTP is amazing. Yes, meditation is a great tool. Yes, the GMAT Ninja videos are extremely valuable. But when it comes down to it, sometimes you just get a bad draw. this is helpful to some people. And again, if you're reading this and still haven't jumped in. Don't waste another day.

I encountered a few problems that I forgot how to do, so I've gone back and reviewed them and feel very confident with Quant overall.

About halfway through Quant, I acknowledged that I had probably fucked it all up and would be back in 16 days to try and salvage things.   thinking set in.  Why did I rush to take the test?  I should have taken a day to catch up on sleep!  My mock tests were all bullshit!  What am I going to tell my recommenders?  I blew it and I can’t apply this round?  Fuck my mask is all sweaty, fuck the test center, fuck this dry scratchy cheap pen!  All bullshit and nothing useful here. resolved to try and do well on the rest of the test.  Maybe I could score well on V/IR/AWA and this would be a good rehearsal for my next attempt.  I bit my lip and tried to redeem myself. out, the GMAT algorithm is a massive head-fuck.  Test day pressure makes this easy to forget.. so remember it and don’t lose your cool over every little thing.  I definitely goofed, but the sorting hat put me damn close to my mock scores.  Please keep my experience in mind when you take the test.  The algorithm is going to make the test feel terrible and it’s up to you to stick to the game plan no matter what.  You’re going to get some questions wrong — but you’re also going to drain some 3pt shots that make the algorithm see you’re a smart motherfucker.

0,"Will I ever be capable of reaching my goal of an elite GMAT score? started my test prep in May of this year and have spent \~400+ hours prepping for this damn exam. I've done every question in the OG for both verbal and quant. I have done basically every mock test out there. Not sure what else I can possibly do. I've scored between 710 and 770 on all of the mocks (aside from the initial diagnostics). Official GMAT - 710; 50Q, 35V (October 16th) score was rather encouraging. I figured that my quant was already elite and that I just had to hammer down verbal concepts until I could get that coveted 42V+ score. I studied verbal NON-STOP for nearly two months and finally got to a point where I felt comfortable with all three subcategories of the Verbal section. Official GMAT - 720; 51Q, 37V (December 7th) was at a loss for words. I really don't know what else to do to increase my verbal score. I'm a native speaker, so I don't really struggle much with reading comp. I guess SC is my weaker subject, but I've watched all of the GMATNinja videos, made an error log, and constantly reviewed the OG questions. At this point, I don't know what to think.  guess the point of this rant is to ask - has anyone had success increasing their verbal from the Mid 30s to the 40s? Which verbal guides are the best? Manhattan ""All the Verbal"" vs. TTP? Veritas Prep?  decided I'm going to give it one last shot and see how I do. I'm going to do a full on verbal course and start from scratch.

0,"Took the GMAT online last week and there was a significant deviation from my desired score. This was largely due to nerves (and a seemingly higher difficulty compared to the mocks) on quant, but I clearly made some mistakes on verbal.  exactly should i spend the next two weeks prepping for a retake? My quant score on the mocks was Q47-50 and my verbal score was V35-42. I've been practicing a lot of verbal, with most of my effort on SC. Quant is something I generally feel comfortable with all around, but clearly my confidence can be shot during the test. I think I just need to practice more word problems. those who consistently score 40+ on verbal , what helped you really get to that level? I've gone through the Manhattan SC book and it was helpful, but translating everything into questions testing multiple elements is difficult. I get about 65%-75% of the 600-700 level questions correct on SC, and it's usually the obscure questions that throw me off. Subject verb is straightforward for me, but parallelism seems to be my biggest issue.  a few questions: How should I solidify my quant score? Flashcards? Practice my weaknesses? Practice translating word problem?

Any tips for scanning and identifying key markers in the sentence to guide me to the right answer? How to get faster?

After reading many debriefs on gmatclub, Reddit, and Quora, and talking with some of my friends who scored above 700, I have decided to go with e-gmat for the verbal section and TTP for the quant. my project is finished and it will take some time for my company to allocate a new project, I have like 45-50 days on the bench. I can put in 7-8 hours a day to study for the GMAT. Can anyone suggest to me a combined study plan while using e-gmat and TTP? am able to grab the concepts but I find it hard to maintain my performance. How do I keep on revising to maintain my performance? Should I rewatch the videos or just practise the questions? the PSP given by e-gmat do any help? How do I combine it with TTP to get the best out of both (e-gmat and TTP)? I have planned: Give the Sigma-X mock (provided free by e-gmat) to check my current level. Go with my stronger section first to leverage my score. (I think I am better at Quant than verbal as I am an Indian engineer male). After finishing Quant, I will start my verbal and will keep on doing some quant questions to maintain my quant performance. In verbal, planning to give 10 days to each section (SC, CR, RC). Once I finish one section such as SC, I will give e-gmat’s cementing quiz with a target of above 75 percentile for medium questions and above 60 percentile for hard questions. After I reach the above targets, I will go with the SC ability quiz with a target of above 75 percentile. Similarly, for CR ad RC. After I finish with SC and CR, I will start practising questions of SC and CR using Custom Quiz. After I finish with both the courses, I will give the official GMAT prep mock 1. Then I will analyze my score and work on my weak areas to improve my performance before the next mock. After that, I will give the free mocks (by Manhattan, GMATclub, Veritas). A few days before my final exam, I will give official GMAT prep mock 2.

My journey had its ups and downs, but ultimately ended in success. I began with a cold Practice test and scored a 640 (38q/40v). I felt good, but this test actually set me up for a large mental error: don’t let a good verbal score fool you into not taking verbal seriously. I did just that. I studied TTP only, without any verbal attention, from April-July. TTP can really beat you into submission, but if you really focus it gives you amazing foundations. I finished TTP, with only a little Geometry remaining, by mid July. I would consider my studying at this time “moderately serious.” I felt good, and decided to do practice tests weekly. In a row, I got a 690, 650, and a 600. The third mock had a 27V in the split. I was devastated, and really thought long and hard about the test and my goals. I’m an incredibly anxious test taker, even on mocks. I think the anxiety was really getting to me, but I reassessed what I needed to do and completely dedicated myself to studying. that rock-bottom verbal score, I realized avoiding verbal was a mistake. I had only casually studied verbal during that time period but I think that light study hurt more than helped. I scored well relying on my ear, but when I tried to integrate rules into the ear-use it hurt my ability to answer questions. This score is what really set me up for success, however, because it got me to take verbal seriously. From August to September I did Quant and Verbal review. Quant was TTP+OG and Verbal was the same but also with Manhattan. TTP and Manhattan are great for verbal foundations. I would do 30-50 questions every day during the week, and maybe double that on weekends. I’ll bullet out some methods later, but I used some tricks that Marty from TTP talked about and they were huge for me in verbal as well as quant. At the end of August I took 2 mocks, and scored a 720 and then a 690. My Verbal problems weren’t gone completely, because I was still using my ear sometimes, but on the 690 I scored a 40Q/44V. I knew I had really gotten back to my cold score in a real way on verbal, and that I needed to see if the 40Q was real. I think my Quant was suffering from both the long time frame of my studies and the shift in focus between Q/V in a kind of hard-pivot way. I felt OK at this point, but not great due to the 40Q, so I scheduled my test for October 1st and took Manhattan/GMATClub Mocks every week. I drilled OG extremely hard for Quant in this time but didn’t ignore verbal. Manhattan and GMATClub are harder in Quant (and verbal for Manhattan, imo) than gmac, so I was scoring in the mid 40s for quant and maybe slightly lower for GMATClub. I felt I was ready enough, and began to retake mocks. Retakes are inflated, but my scores were 740/760/740/770. I felt best about how I was answering SC questions and my Quant score. Since many of my Quant scores weren’t strong, I didn’t see a lot of repeats. My Q range during this period was 47-50. booked my real test for early October, then another for the end of October and an online one for mid November. I took the test in the test center and felt super anxious and also lost quant time during my break. I ended up with a 45q/41v for a 700. This wasn’t the score I wanted, but was actually great. It helped me conquer my anxiety. Next test felt different. I was answering quickly and confidently. I ended up with a 720 (48/41) after basically doing review in the time between tests. The final test I had less review done, but felt extremely calm. I had completely let go of my anxiety and was 100% in the zone for verbal, but quant felt a little off. I got a 750 (47Q/46V) and was shocked but elated. Tips:** If you’re an older test taker, don’t underestimate the rust you’ll have. The mindset took a long time for me to develop.
* Don’t make your study path longer than it should be. Leave yourself enough time to do retakes, but don’t study long enough that you forget concepts. I lost some time having to redo quant studies.
* Quant is reasoning too. A lot of the questions you can logic around, even if you don’t know the exact answer it will help you on harder questions.
* Start reading the economist. Teach yourself to love the most boring articles. The difference between articles I enjoyed and articles I found boring is the difference between a perfect passage or missing 2-3 questions. I also didn’t take notes, and did fine. It’s preference.
* Adopt the streak method. Marty from TTP talks about this. Don’t do medium questions until you get 15 easy in a row right. Don’t do hard until you get 10-15 mediums right. I did this for every section, and I think it helped most for SC.
* Treat SC and CR as a pitch. Sell yourself on the answer. I did these untimed in both TTP and OG, and found that talking through the answer as if I was selling it helped a lot. My hard question efficiency became really great on OG due to this method. I struggled with time on verbal at first, but this method helped a ton.
* TTP is great for foundations in quant and verbal. It’s also great for SC. I didn’t like any third party for CR, I don’t think the logical traps are the same between OG and any other service. Manhattan is good for verbal foundations as well. The way they outline rules is really nice, and helped me a lot.
* My verbal success really came from doing a ton of questions, and looking them up on GMATClub once I got to a high level. Breaking through 40-41 was the point for me, but I think it’s mostly an exposure issue. Even when scoring a 41, I felt like a 51 was a possible score, and just a mindset issue. The margins are so thin, if you’re at a 40 (a real 40, not my fake cold 40) then you can get a great verbal score by eliminating some mental factors.
* Anxiety! Shout out to fellow anxious test takers. I had to turn anxiety into excitement, and that helped, but what helped most was getting a decent (but below target) score. I knew that I had the answers in me, and that I had an OK score. I honestly just stopped caring as much. I went in calm, and when I got anxious I’d close my eyes for 2 seconds and go back to the question. You can only control the question in front of you. So kill that question.
* Don’t ignore a section! Almost forgot this one. I recommend a balanced study approach. Do tests to realize your weaknesses and then eliminate them. Truly understanding verbal took me longer than I thought, so don’t make the same mistake. My verbal score crashed from learning rules and skyrocketed when I was able to apply them naturally. I tried to cut this down and streamline it, but I’m completely open to answering any questions. I appreciate all the help this community has given me, and hope I can help even just one other person. I wanted to thank Marty from TTP especially, as his no-BS attitude and insight into practice techniques helped me get through some rough times along this journey.

I had like 15 questions wrong in Quant &amp; rushed through verbal quite a bit (1 week ago)
as this was my first time taking a GMAT practice test + I only completed about 25% of the Manhattan Prep All the GMAT books, I felt pretty good about that score  I got roundabout 55% of the Manhattan books done and did my first Practice exam from MBA.com......

 have the whole day to myself these days and can sit for a good 5-6 hours a day for my preparation (hopefully even more once i start a course)  
 feel comfortable just solving questions from a book the whole day but have been told that its better to take a course to prepare for an adaptive test like GMAT.  
 am above average in Verbal and i feel i was able to get through the math foundations book quite easily and knew every topic the book covered (i just solved all the practice questions from the book without really going through most of the chapters) and i aim to get a 700+  
 looking for a flexible course that would let me go at my own pace (solving questions for 6 hours a day is a good day for me, with bad days ranging from 2-3 hours)  
i also am not sure if i need a video class teaching me the concepts and feel i could do with solving questions on my own but i'm not sure if thats a good strategy.  
i basically am looking for some structure with a course to help me believe that i'm not wasting time solving the same type of questions or the same level of questions repeatedly that i quite often feel when solving every single question in a book.  
 i would like to ask if solving whole books is a good strategy in itself or would a course be more beneficial.

0,"Hey everyone! I've been a lurker on this forum for a few months and wanted to contribute a little in regard to a studying strategy. I am a very visual person and while I love TTP I wanted something physical and organized that I could tangibly look through as I studied and to keep track of my progress.  printed out all the Active Review as TTP says and I also created blank templates for the Chapter Review Tests. So basically for each chapter I have the Active Review Sheets and and a template for however many chapter tests there are coupled with a review sheet for each. In the picture linked [here]( you can see how much space this all takes up (3.5 inch binder). This is for the entire TTP Quant Track, I have a separate (and much much smaller) binder for the TTP Verbal Track. I've found this method really helpful versus just keeping all your notes in a notebook or something. I can quickly flip through each chapter and see my scores for each test along with the reviews sheets for questions I missed. It's nice having it all printed out including the tests/review sheets because I can physically see the progress I've made and how much I have left to do.  the tests I created [this]( sheet. The chapter and test number goes on the left and on the right I can fill in info on my TPQ (time per question) and my Score. I then highlight these based on whether I met the target accuracy or 2 minute or less mark. Green = Target Met and Red = Target Missed. My review sheets echo a similar format, just with an area to fill in which questions I reviewed.  found this method really really helpful and I'm an organization freak and I'm sure some of y'all are too so I thought I'd share. I would love any other suggestions anyone might have or any methods you have found helpful!  about \~40% done with TTP Quant and 30% done overall. Been loving (but also hating haha) TTP and it has transformed my studying. Before I was using Manhattan Prep and the book/practice format was not working for me at all..... If you have any hesitations about starting TTP and feel like you want to brush using other prep first, DON'T. Don't waste your time like I did.

0,"Hey everyone, always been a very passive Reddit reader (my first ever post), but I've relied on reading your stories and tips so much the past few months that I wanted to share my story and hopefully give back. Background** Native English speaker
* Non-Quant background Journey** the recommendation of a friend, I started with the full suite of Manhattan books on 7/15. Prior to starting studying material, I took the first Manhattan CAT, scoring a V29 V44 (590). I came to find out that the Q44 was a fluke and I should have scored quite a bit lower. My next Manhattan CAT, after two weeks of studying exclusively Manhattan materials 5+ hours per day, fell to a 570. I was understandably frustrated and demoralized. the fall in my quant score was perplexing and led me to realize that my quant foundation was very weak. After making it through the majority of the Manhattan All the Quant series, I quickly decided that I would need to build my quant foundation from ground zero. Based on all of your recommendations, I turned to TTP and never looked back. all of you know, TTP can be grueling. Single chapters can take days to weeks with hundreds of problems per chapter, but it's more than worth it if you have the time and commitment. I continued taking Manhattan CATs during my TTP and Manhattan verbal studies as to not extinguish my official CATs (highly recommend this strategy), and slowly but surely, my CAT scores were rising, but almost all on the Verbal side. Again, I was really confused and since my TTP test scores were relatively strong (75% to 80% on the hard tests) and I felt my quant conceptual basis was strengthening. completed most of TTP, I took my first in-person exam (V31 Q42 600). Again, absolutely crushed and demoralized. I started questioning again whether I could get to my 700+ mark. After sulking for a few days, I hopped back on the horse and started tuning my studies with other sources. This is when I realized TTP is a tool, not a solution. TTP questions can be incredibly difficult, but they ultimately do not precisely simulate GMAC official questions. Equipped with everything that I learned through TTP, I started hitting the OG guides **hard**. I logged my errors, revisited weak topics, and by the end, I could answer every question (at least quant) without fail. This was probably a function of memorization, but memorization is somewhat beneficial on the GMAT as you can refer back when solving similar questions. This is really when I saw an inflection in my Quant score, going from a Q42 on my 9/1 live test to a Q49 on my 9/19 CAT. biggest takeaway was how beneficial the OG guides are... once I had the foundation to utilize them properly. Slugging away at OG problems when you don't understand them is simply a waste of your time and a waste of the problem. it was all said and done, I managed to swing from a 570 Manhattan CAT on 8/2 to a 740 official score on 11/13. It was rough, I questioned whether I could get there several times, but I promise, all of you are more than equipped to do the same. The GMAT is a ridiculous test that, in my opinion, tests how bad you want it. If you want it bad enough, I promise that all of you will get to where you want and/or need to be. and Learnings** If you're severely struggling with OG questions at a certain level or on a certain topic... **stop**. Go back and reinforce that topic or practice the same topic at a lower difficulty. You're likely lacking conceptual knowledge, and by hacking away at problems, you're not learning and simply wasting time + problems. If you're anything like me, you'll remember the problem/answer and it will fail to serve its purpose once you're actually ready to solve it.
* Resetting GMATPrep exams can be very useful when your initial performance was poor. I received a few repeats, but overall since my first takes were relatively poor, the majority of the questions were new. When you do receive a familiar question though, penalize yourself on timing (wait an extra X seconds before submitting), otherwise, you're cheating yourself on timing simulation. A few seconds here and there make a big difference across the entire test.
* Don't neglect verbal, especially if you're coming from a non-quant background. This was probably my biggest mistake early on. Not having the quant foundation, I was placing 95+% of my time towards quant because I knew its where I could make the biggest dent in my score. But once I started hitting consistently in the Q47+ range, I should have started weighing my studies more equally. At Q47+, you've proved to schools that you can handle quant work, now focus on scoring big and upping your Verbal, which is a heavier weight in your composite score. Going from V39 to V43 is going to be a lot more effective use of your time than Q47 to Q51. Balance is key to big scores, and you won't get there by neglecting verbal.
* **ERROR LOG... ERROR LOG... ERROR LOG...** there is no better way to identify your weaknesses. And don't simply log your errors, log your struggle problems as well. If a question took you too long yet you still got it right, log it. Timing on difficult problems is ultimately how you secure higher scores, so you should consider taking 2.5+ minutes to solve an error.
* I know everyone says this, but read sentence correction for meaning. You're never going to learn every rule or idiom that the GMAT tests, and even if you do, that doesn't account for all the exceptions. By reading for meaning, equipped with basic grammar rules, you'll be more than good to go.
* You're going to have ups and downs. It will feel like a setback, but use these opportunities to understand why you're struggling. Often it's something as simple as a single topic or two. This is where the error log comes in handy as you can narrow down quickly and start seeing patterns. Manhattan Prep All-The-Verbal/Quant (didn't use Quant much, but relied on Verbal)

I'm sharing my experience with you all in the hopes that it helps someone out - much like how this sub has helped me over the last year. (remember: *anyone* can score well on the GMAT, I just found backgrounds to be really interesting when I was browsing this sub): Native english speaker
* Business admin undergrad
* I would say my verbal skills were much better than my quant before I started to study Highly (x100) recommend Manhattan Prep's All the Verbal for verbal studying
   * I made this book my best friend. I made flashcards. I took notes. I read it for fun while on the couch. 
   * For SC and CR, I found their suggestion of completing the sentence ""When I see \_\_\_"" really helpful. Basically, identify what you must remember when you see a specific split in an SC question or word in a CR stem. For example, ""When I see an its/their split, I know I'm looking for noun-verb agreement."" I took this a step further to say ""Let's go find the subject this refers to"". This felt silly for a while, but it helped me maintain a rhythm while encountering clunky sentences and tricky splits.
* Target Test Prep
   * I can't speak highly enough of this program!
   * The modules that made the biggest impact for me were number properties, geometry, work/rate problems, and combinations. Seriously, if you nail number properties, you're bound to get 1-2 freebie DS questions on the exam.
* 2020 OG
   * For the week leading up to the test, it was me, my OG, my whiteboard, and some white noise playlists.
   * I aimed to complete 50-100 questions a day leading up to the test. I rotated the concepts between quant and verbal and reviewed each and every wrong answer. I made myself verbalize out loud what I did wrong. Oftentimes, when we review our wrong answers we go ""Oh right, ok, I'll get that next time"". Make that more likely by listening to yourself say what you got wrong. *Why* you got it wrong.  Exams: 2/2020 GMAC #1: 610 (Q41, V33)

* 4/2020 GMAC #2: 710 (Q46, V42)
   * The jump from 610 to 710 can be attributed to getting to know the test better. That 9 point jump in verbal was *all* Manhattan Prep.

   * The Online GMAT is a practical application of Murphy's Law. No matter how reliable your wifi is, how historically quiet your neighbors are, or how dry your phone usually is - when you are taking the online exam something can and will go wrong.
   * My wifi dropped 6 times. My neighbors started what I can only describe as a rave. The proctor made me swivel my laptop around to show my workstation in the middle of my exam - the clock did not stop.
* Also - this may have been my misunderstanding, but is the online test always quant first? I had practiced all verbal first, so that threw me for a loop.
* If you're going to take the online test (again, don't), get yourself the expo ultrafine markers. Save 2 for test day and practice with the rest. These become blunt really quick, but they're really thin which will reduce your chances of misreading your work.

 everyone,  posts helped me a lot while studying for the GMAT with motivation and planning so I decided to share my path as well.  was near the end of July when I finalized that I wanted to do an MBA but didn't know exactly where. I decided that my GMAT score would determine the schools I would aim for.  Test: 670 (V37/Q45) took the first test available on GMAC for free so I could see where I was at, what the GMAT was like, and what I needed to focus on. I then booked an exam for Oct 3rd in person. I booked early because Coronavirus made availability scarce. officially started studying on August 1st. My study plan was M-F, 3 hours a day after work. Saturday I would take a practice exam. Sunday I would review it and plan for the week. It was key for me to have some break on the weekend since I was getting off work at 5, studying 6-9, and then sleeping by 10 every night.  first 2 weeks I went through a Princeton Review book I checked out from my local library and the OG that I had a PDF of. After that, I used TTP for everything. I focused mainly on Quant since that was easier for me to grasp and iI felt like I could make the most gains there. I knew my baseline verbal was low and it was always lower than my Quant but I still focused more on Quant. I usually did a 3/2 split of Quant 3 days of the week and Verbal 2 days of the week.  1-3 were the 3 practice exams from the best free sources I could find. Manhattan, Veritas, and GMAT  Club. GMAT Club was so hard and demotivating that I posted on Reddit to see if they are harder than the rest or was I just imagining it. And they are much harder than anything else.  4-6 I went back to the official website and bought the extra ones they had as well. My score jumped 100 points from Test 3 to Test 4 and I thought official was just easier than the rest or I did really good but the next two exams ruled the latter out. My assumption by Test 6 was that I was doing well and I don't want to wait until Oct 3rd to take the test now. So I booked an online exam for the next weekend.  Official - Online - 710 (V41/Q46) IR:3 was really happy to see this score. I knew my studying was paying off and even though I only had marginally improved in Quant my verbal had improved considerably. So I knew it would be even more challenging to go up from here. Als,o I was really sad to see my IR so low. messed up here. I had two weeks until the in-person person I had booked. I got too relaxed and my mother came to visit.  Official - In-Person - 690 (Vx/Qx) canceled this score so I don't know the breakdown but I left the testing center very dejected. But I got home and booked the next online exam for Nov 14. I was back to studying on Oct 14th. One month exactly to go. I got a fresh TTP account (since I had paid someone for the time left before) so that I could take the exams fresh and see my proper scores. Since I only had a month I took a hard test for each subject. If I met the accuracy I went to the next subject. If I didn't then I read through and took it again. I got through all the math this way and was able to focus on what I knew were my weak spots. It was around 2 weeks until the exam that I discovered GMAT Ninja Verbal videos. These were amazing. I took two more official practice tests in the span of a week and fluctuated between doing good on verbal or good on quant. I was worried that I couldn't do well even in the Mocks now whereas before I did better than my official score in the Mock.  Official - Online - 730 (V41/Q49) IR:8 got the email that scores were available and the website went down for like over an hour. I was so freaking stressed. But finally the website worked and I saw the hard work of my studying had paid off. I got a 730 and had improved my Quant and IR from last online. I find it amusing that my verbal stayed the same even tho I spent a good chunk of time going through GMAT Ninja Verbal videos. I still recommend them because I feel like they are what kept me at 41 vs going down. and Recommendations a deadline. Even if you give yourself 6 months to study, book a test for the end of the 6 months. Make a deadline that you have to meet or else motivation is hard to keep going.  a baseline and make your goals realistic from there. -If you have a short time frame as I did, a practice exam every week helps a lot. it shows you what you are missing and gets you used to the exam format.  Recs: a free copy of Princeton Review and the OG and go through them first. Get your basics about the exam format, about Quant and Verbal, and about question style out the way. This will help you get started with studying also. The first week was tough because I hadn't studied in a long time. Test Prep is amazing for quant. I know it is commonly said on this subreddit and I felt like people got repetitive in every post recommending it but it really is that good. The chapter and chapter test format combined with the stats and custom test option I think helps curb a lot of the downsides of self-guided. You have a structure. I recommend it at the price they provide though I paid a little less for all 3 months. Verbal I would recommend a mix of TTP (if paying for it already) and GMAT Ninja verbal videos. I didn't use much else for verbal but I also didn't improve it as much so YMMV. that is all I have! If you have any questions please ask away and I am happy to help anyone.

If you're still answering questions from a book, put that shit down and use this website.** I quickly realised that my diagnostic verbal scores on [MBA.com]( were just pure luck; my sentence correction scores were all over the place. day: I did a few more quant sections and a few more verbal sections. day: I did a few more quant sections and a few more verbal sections. I looked at a few grammar guides and cheat sheets but none of them seemed to click. day: I did a few more quant sections and a few more verbal sections. **I skimmed through Manhattan Prep's book on sentence corrections. This shit is gold for sentence correction questions.** day: I did a few more quant sections and a few more verbal sections. I briefly looked at IR and **I took down some notes from** [**this AWA guide**]( The AWA guide is solely responsible for my perfect essay score - I would've scored a 4 without this guide.** day: My actual test seemed significantly more challenging than the mock tests on [MBA.com]( (especially quant). Holy shit...I ran out of time on both the math and verbal section. I was also so goddamn nervous on test day, which may have negatively impacted my score; I distinctively remember getting a question right AND selecting the wrong answer.

Hope you find something in here that could help!  the test (studying)** there are 2 key areas to get good at during your prep: (1) conceptual and (2) mental, sequentially
   * (1) conceptual means all the basic knowledge (algebra, grammar, geometry, passage reading, etc.) that creates the foundation of taking the test -- get good at these. 
      * for quant: I think Manhattan books were superb, albeit a bit outdated, but still very very good for basics
      * for verbal (as native english speaker), I mostly **read the news (WSJ)** \-- which has been truly a whirlwind in 2020 -- and did a shitload of practice problems to improve CR and learn the intricacies of grammar for SC that don't often come up in day-to-day
   * (2) mental means all the mind blocks to get over, be it test anxiety, overall anxiety, imposter syndrome, the list goes on for me. also remind yourself to stop pinning your worth on a dumb test -- the gmac exists to progress education but it also exists to profit. this was difficult for me since I tend to freak the fuck out, and it would tank my confidence (and oftentimes my score)
      * besides the whole 8+ hrs of sleep, working out, breathing exercises (all super helpful), what worked for me was this: **mentally turn your nerves into excitement** \-- yes I know you hate this but you have to admit... some of these problems and passages are actually really interesting
      * what also weirdly worked was **making myself freak out** as much as possible during mocks/practice questions -- I knew this was a hurdle for me so I decided to be prepared to panic on the actual thing
* eventually you start to find out what strategy works for you. for me (I felt like conceptually I was good more or less), it was: attempt all questions if you can see a/the method in the first 30 seconds or so, but guess if you can't and move on
* I used Manhattan Prep and Veritas prep tests -- MP definitely felt harder but it helped me prepare (1) and (2) above 
* also practice under testing conditions which means same time of day, same location, and **no break** besides the 5 minutes between V and IR -- this was vital for building endurance the test (performing)** things went decently smoothly but a few things to watch out for:
   * **USE THE BATHROOM BEFORE THE TEST** \-- despite this I still rushed the last few questions of verbal because I **really** needed to go
   * have water (but not too much) nearby to hydrate
   * check in process with your phone meant having to take a photo of your ID with your front camera... while it's on a flat surface. super weird, threw me off for 5 minutes, but just do your best
   * I sometimes whisper to myself or mutter -- more than once the chat bubble popped up to remind me of this. try to avoid, chat bubble is distracting especially when time was invaluable
   * sometimes there are noises and they throw me off, and since we can't use earplugs (I asked), sometimes I would plug my ears with my fingers during verbal, which helped, and I didn't get a chat bubbling telling me no the test (waiting)** this actually felt the worst -- but all I can say is... you did your best, that's all you can ask for, and if you did poorly then you just take it again at a later time
* back to (2) above -- it is just a test and **does not define in any way your self worth**. we all hate standardized testing and thank god most (if not all) schools look beyond numbers

I have to thank this subreddit for its inspirational posts, resources, and advice that helped me get over the finish line. Here's some quick reflections over the past month. Timeline reference, I got IR8 on all exams, both practice and official.  OG 1 - 710 (Q49, V38) - July 26

* OG 5 - 770 (Q50, V45) - Nov 1
* **Official 2 - 760 (Q50, V42, AWA not graded yet) - Nov 9**  Reflections on Official 2 I took all my exams in the following order: Verbal, Quant, IR, AWA
* Verbal was pretty on par with what I had seen on OGs. 
* Quant was still much harder than anything I had seen on the OGs. It's somewhere in between OG Practice Quants and MGMAT Quants in terms of difficulty. 
* IR was on par with OGs Tips and Advice Honestly, everything in u/goodfella27's advice in his post ([ is solid, read it in its entirety. I'll add very little to it, but the most important thing from his/her post that I would have told me past self 4 months ago was to read his/her ""ideal schedule"". In fact, I made the following mistakes in my own schedule:
   * Drilling OG practice problems before I had a solid foundation of the concepts.
   * Using the OG 1 practice test as a cold diagnostic. OGs should be used for practice once you're close to the end, since there are so few of them.  
* In addition to u/goodfella27's advice, I would add these things to boost verbal, which was my weakest area:
   * **TTP Verbal is great and I recommend the program.** I already had a strong math background so TTP's quant was a useful source of hard problems, but what really helped me from TTP was their verbal practice. Yes it is still in beta and yes some of the questions are ridiculously (bordering unreasonably) hard, but TTP taught me the key concepts for SC and CR. These concepts translated pretty cleanly to the OG problems and made them seem much easier. In fact, for better or for worse, I began worrying that I was thinking about problems wrong because when 700-level SC and CR problems started to get easier for me, I thought it was because I was falling for trap answers. Nope! I was just getting better at Verbal. 
      *  I had tried Manhattan Prep's SC and CR booklets, and while they were helpful, but I found TTP's breakdown more comprehensive and went more in depth. For example, TTP really starts from simple building blocks up to correcting full sentences or understanding full arguments. 
   * **Verbal is totally learnable and it was the area I had the biggest room to grow.** After going through the TTP problems, going through enough OG problems, and reading through solutions, I got a sense of what intuitively felt right or wrong in SC and CR problems. Of course intuition is not enough, but it allowed me to make quicker judgements about answers, which was especially helpful when the clock was running. I felt this intuition really accelerate between my first official test and second official test, when I was focusing 6 days a week on verbal and just using 1 day to keep my quant rust-free. 
   * **In addition to understanding why each right answer is right, understand why each wrong answer is wrong.** Just as GMATNinja says, there is not only 1 right answer, but 4 wrong answers to each verbal question. Reading through each wrong answer and understand why it's wrong is just as important as understanding the concepts being tested. This helped me avoid other patterns and incorrectly applied concepts that tried to trick me into wrong answers on future problems. 
   * **Read!** After my first official test and my 38 verbal score, I made a serious commitment to read more in the next month to calibrate my grammar, sentence structure, and thinking process towards the GMAT. I had read a lot of advice on how the Economist is good GMAT reading material, but even then I was surprised by how similar the tone, structure, and word choice of the GMAT is to the Economist material. If I had known better, I would have started reading the Economist earlier on in my practice. So I started reading the Economist. Not only did it help with my RC, I started seeing comparison, parallelism, and other SC concepts in the sentences. In those moments, I would pause to understand how those sentences were constructed and make mental notes about why that ""which"" was there, or ""expletive it"" was used, etc.  all of you folks taking the GMAT soon, good luck, I wish you the best. Persevere through the studying, you can get the score you want! I was pretty discouraged after my first test of 710. Although it was good, my mocks indicated I could do better, so I persevered, studied every day for the next month, and got the score I wanted.

0,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my GMAT study experience and timeline to give back to the sub a bit because it has been so helpful to me. I will share a timeline of my various mocks up until test day and what I did between the takes. I'll also share what worked for me and what didn't. TL;DR at the bottom. take 3/15/19  - Q42 / V22 530** was a genuine cold take, I knew nothing about the exam, its structure, the type of questions asked, etc. I was pretty disappointed with this verbal score since I am a native English speaker and all I knew at this point was that top 15 schools generally required 730+. I missed the first 4 questions on verbal (which was the section I started with) and I imagine that skewed my results pretty heavily exam 1/7/20 - Q41 / V40 670** would not recommend waiting so long between takes, I just had a lot of time to do this so I studied pretty infrequently. A lot of my time was spent learning about the structure of the exam from a Princeton Review GMAT book and then studying verbal questions from this book. (I would not recommend this book over OG) I also discovered this sub and browsed it a lot, overall there was more daydreaming about an MBA than actual studying for it. Poor discipline from me. exam 6/13/20 - Q48 / V37 - 700** this take and the last one I went through TTP's quant curriculum for 4 months and I could not recommend it enough.  It is very thorough, almost too thorough at times, but I learned a lot of concepts. It was easy for me to lose motivation during TTP's hard sections, but TTP's medium section is most similar to the actual GMAT test in my experience. I also did not study verbal really at all in this time, so the dip in score was expected. I don't recommend doing that, it's good to stay fresh. exam 7/13/20 - Q47 / V42 - 730** time I started doing OG questions from the OG Verbal Review 2020 book and it helped me clean up my verbal again very quickly. To me, it felt like a lot of luck is involved for quant. Sometimes the early questions feel incredibly difficult or at least time consuming, and other times they feel very easy. This was one of the times they felt hard. exam - 8/8/20 - Q49 / V41 - 740** felt pretty confident after the last test that I could maybe get a 750 with a Q50/V42  split if I worked harder on my quant. To get this I bought the Manhatten Prep Advanced Quant book and it felt it was useful, but more OG quant questions probably could have served me similarly. The book has some good guessing strategies, but a lot of them I already knew and used from TTP. exam - 8/29/20 Q49 / V38 - 720** was pretty disappointed with this, I'd studied quant extra hard the last month and I was disappointed to not improve to a Q50. Verbal was always my weak spot, so I just hoped to get a 40+ on test day with a bit of luck. This was taken with a whiteboard and at the same time as my planned test time to simulate test conditions. exam (retake of exam 1) - 9/25/20 Q50 / V42 - 750** had been so long since I had first taken my Test 1 I thought there would be no harm in doing it again. Between this practice test and the last I just kept doing OG problems to stay sharp. I was thrilled with this score, but there's a chance these scores were less accurate than the others because I may have done some duplicate questions without noticing. This was taken with a whiteboard and at the same time as my planned test time to simulate test conditions. exam - 9/28/20 - n/a** finishing the sign up I waited for my exam to start for 30 minutes, no proctor arrived, so I closed the test. I submitted the rescheduling form on their support page, no one answered in 2 weeks so I called Pearson to open a case. I did not get a follow-up on the case in the time period promised, so I called again, and then they let me schedule the retake. exam - 11/29/20 - Q48/V46/IR5 750** felt less confident for this than when I was meant to take it last month. I did the same ritual as before, I took the day off the Monday of the test, I spent the whole weekend reviewing weak concepts, and the day of I did 5 medium level questions of each category CR/SC/RC/PS/DS to warm up. the quant at the beginning, I felt I got some extremely time consuming/challenging questions for the first 4 questions or so. And after that they got significantly easier. I felt at that point my chance of getting a high quant score was gone and I planned to retake. For verbal I felt the questions were extremely easy throughout, significantly easier than the OG questions or the other [MBA.com]( tests I had done. In the back of my mind I was worried I was making stupid mistakes and that is why I was getting easier questions. And then finally for IR the questions I got were significantly harder than any of the practice tests I'd done where I routinely got 7s and 8s on IR. I feel this was luck of the draw though. was solid, although I still plan to do an in person retake in case I can get that Q49/Q50 without my verbal suffering too much. The verbal score really came out of nowhere, I never came close to that sort of score in my practices and I cannot imagine I will do it again for in person. major takeaways for me as a TL;DR:** Studying for a long amount of time is nice, but I wouldn't recommend longer than 6 months once you ""get serious"" In order of helpfulness of resources I used I would say OG questions &gt; TTP &gt; Manhattan Prep &gt; anything else I do not think there is a lot of value in a truly ""cold"" first take. 530 to 750 makes for a nice story but I do not think a 530 was an accurate assessment of my initial aptitude for the test. I feel its more useful to at least understand the types of questions on the exam to assess your ability There really seems to be a lot of luck involved in the types of questions you get, so you should plan to take it more than once if needed. There is no shame in that. I had several month long periods where I only studied quant or only studied verbal, this was a bad idea because I had to take time to catch up on whatever section after doing this which only lengthened my timeline. I started my journey a few months after graduating my undergrad and I still have about a year until even applying for business schools.

I've done over 1000+ official verbal questions and have even maintained an error log. I haven't been able to cross the V40 mark. Test Score (Gmatprep Mock 1, December 2018): Scored 670 - Q48, V34
I started giving mocks 2 weeks back:
-GmatPrep Mock 1: 720 (Q49, V40)
-GmatPrep Mock 2: 710 (Q50, V36)
-MGMAT: 670 (Q45, V36)
-Kaplan 1: 730 (Q50, V40)
-Kaplan 2: 680 (Q49, V34)
-Kaplan 3: 710 (Q49, V38)
I have bought Official Practice Test 3,4 and plan to give them by the end of this week.
I've also given GmatClub Quant CATs (Q49, Q47, Q46, Q50, Q50, Q44). Overall my quant score lies in the range Q48-Q50. my verbal score is fluctuating. Getting a V34 again was disappointing. Some things I've observed after analyzing my mocks:
1. CR accuracy is usually above 70%
2. RC accuracy depends from test to test. (I found Manhattan's and Kaplan's RCs unreasonably difficult; 80%+ accuracy on official mocks ).
3. My SC accuracy is probably the worst and I've been consistently getting these questions wrong despite devoting most of my time on SC preparation.
4. I've been using some pacing and timing strategies; However, I still run short of time (4-7 minutes) I've been practising Gmatprep SC questions (from practice tests 1,2). Mostly 600-700 and 700+ level questions. On average, I've been getting 9/10 correct. Incorrect ones:- I am able to eliminate 3 choices and end up selecting the wrong choice (the closest choice). be applying to the top Mim Programs next year and need to get a 740+ to increase my chances (I come from a Tier 3 college, so...)
I'm usually calm during the exam so it's not a problem of nerves love to get some suggestion and advice for increasing my verbal score. you in advance!",Verbal Scoring not improving,1603804629,4,469,1

0,"I just sat for my second GMAT today and scored a 640 (Q45 V35) which was the same as my overall score for my first sitting in July 640 (Q39 V39). My goal is a 700+ but I will be satisfied with a 680+.  up to my first sitting I had taken the Economist Test Prep course from August to May at which point it ended and I was unable to continue using it so I only used Official Test Prep Questions to study in the two months leading up to the test in July.  my second sitting I completed TTP Quant (only completed two modules of verbal, didn't have time to delve into it). I focused mainly on quant and only reread Manhattan SC and did some practice questions from the Official Prep as I felt my Verbal was pretty consistent (scoring around 40 on all my GMAC mock tests). TTP was extremely beneficial for quant and I think I could've seen an even higher score on my quant section but I ended up with some pretty weird questions.  Test Results Leading Up to October:
GMAC 2 - 9/26 - 700 Q46 V40 Third Retake with 7 months in between
GMAC 3 - 10/8 - 690 Q45 V40 Second Retake with 7 Months in between

GMAC 6 - 10/18 700 Q47 V39 First take retaking the tests there were some questions that looked familiar but I did not recall the answers or how to solve them and had to solve them from scratch. am currently unsure what to and I am beginning to become very discouraged and am wondering if my score goal is a reality at this point. I am considering retaking the test for a third time however the next available day in my area is in February. I am unsure what to do for 4 months between now and the next test. I could complete TTP Verbal and spend some more time on Verbal but if I continue with TTP Quant I am worried that I will start to memorize the questions and start to forget the underlying skill set. Not sure if taking a step back from studying for a bit would be beneficial. I am also running out of tests to take.

0,"Hey all, is going to a long and meandering post. In summary, I've taken two online GMATs and didn't get the score I want (710+), what should be my next steps for my in-person on November 21st? expand on this, I've been studying since the beginning of the year after getting a diagnostic score of 570. I started off with Manhattan but switched to TTP for Quant which helped me learned the material incredibly well. Once I finished all Quant modules in TTP, I used TTP, Manhattan, and GMAT Ninja for Verbal. Once that was complete, I started to do practice tests for my first Online GMAT using Veritas and GMAC practice tests. Going into the practice tests, I knew my strength was Quant and that Verbal was scary. However, something clicked the week leading to the first online exam and I started to do really well on Verbal questions. I went into the first exam thinking if I could maintain my Quant performance and keep this verbal performance up, I could get the score I wanted on my first exam. 1 (Aug 3rd): 660 (Q46, V35, IR 4)
Veritas 2 (Aug 8th): 680 (Q47, V37, IR 6)
Veritas 3 (Aug 18th): 660 (Q44, V37, IR 7)
GMAT Official Practice 1 (Aug 26th): 700 (Q49, V37, IR8)
GMAT Official Practice 2 (Aug 29th): 690 (Q48, V35, IR5)
GMAT Online Test 1 (Sept 5th): 690 (Q45, V40, IR7) the first test, I remember thinking that I did worse than average for Quant but much better on Verbal and the score that I got later reflected that. I also remember the Quant being much more difficult than what I usually got on practice tests. The Online GMAT Quant had a bunch of strange questions that just looked alien to me in what they were asking. Even on hard questions that I got wrong on the practice tests, I could at least understand what they were asking of me. I thought that might have just been nerves because I was nervous going into the exam and panicking a bit due to the questions I was seeing. The Verbal and IR felt about the same. I was depressed and the thought of studying for the test again filled me with massive amounts of dread and anxiety. I decided to take a week break and, with my confidence regained, I scheduled my online retake for three weeks later. I took one more Veritas test and two more GMAT Official Practice tests before the Online retake. During the practice tests, I felt that I did really bad on every single quant section, but my scores were better than I thought. Verbal, on the other hand, I felt pretty good about every single section that I took. 4 (Sept 26th): 670 (Q45, V37, IR4)
GMAT Practice Test 3 (Oct 3rd): 730 (Q48, V41, IR8)
GMAT Practice Test 4 (Oct 10th): 720 (Q48, V40, IR5)
GMAT Online Test 2 (Oct 17th): 670 (Q44, V38, IR4) the exam, I once again felt that I did worse on Quant than I usually did and that I did pretty well on Verbal, but my score was 20 points worse than before. Quant again had a bunch of questions that just felt alien compared to the practice tests I had seen, the questions on TTP, and OG Practice questions. I believe that I had 5 hard Inequality DS problems in a row which just felt super wrong to me even though I understand it's totally possible. Verbal again felt normal, while I felt that IR was harder than ever. As soon as I got my score yesterday, I immediately scheduled an in-person for Nov 21st which is the earliest I could take the exam in-person in my area. Today I am not depressed not am I feeling any dread or anxiety about studying again, I'm actually pretty furious, angry, and determined. I'm on vacation so I physically can't study until I get back on Monday, but I want to kick this test's ass. finished TTP and scored high on all of the tests on there. I study about 4 hours every day and use primarily OG problems so that I practice actual GMAT problems. I got permission to go into the office on weekends so that I may recreate actual test conditions. I have the test booklet and markers to use for practice. I go on GMATclub to learn from particularly hard questions. I am determined to get a score that best represents to my abilities. So the big question is what do I do to make sure that I am actually factually prepared for my in-person test?

0,"Purchased the GMATclub quant CAT pack and i'm not particularly happy with it. The bulk of questions seem significantly more difficult than practice questions either from OG, Manhattan, Magoosh, Veritas, etc - even when supposedly rated at 600, or even 500, level. taken three CATs and a few quizzes over the past few days. The questions don't feel ""GMAT""-y as much as they feel intentionally tricky or math intensive/very nitty-gritty theory intensive. I've gone through the entire official GMAT guide cover to cover, all the Manhattan books, and the additional official prep guides for both quant and verbal. I've also done countless GMATclub forum problems. I can honestly say, without question, that the GMATclub Cats do not reflect the average difficulty for any tier of problem.  will say that my ""score"" has improved over the course of the three CATs, and it has been an eyeopener in terms of some of the minor tweaks that make a problem i'm accustomed to ""harder"" or successfully able to trick me into a mistake, but ultimately it feels like i'm not really learning anything significant or truly getting a gauge for where I'm at in terms of preparedness.  people looking at the GMAT for the first time and thinking ""well harder questions don't sound bad, right? If i'm just really good at that then i'll be good for the test!"". While ultimately true - it just doesn't really work like that for most people. When everything is unnecessarily tricky or math intensive, you end up having to spend far more time per question than your normal pace and you end up having to resort to guessing or janky math to convince yourself of a ""close enough i hope"" answer. The GMAT **will** try to trick you, but the GMATClub CATs have multiple layers of tricks **combined** with minute details in math theory that simply make the problems far more difficult than they should be. This is especially true for the Data Sufficiency problems.  i think the question bank can be good for sets of 10 problem quizzes, but the 31 question CATs feel like a waste of time due to rampant overcomplexity. I haven't taken any of the official CATs yet so maybe i'm full of it, but compared to my studies this my observation.",GMATClub Quant CATs,1603059586,3,448,1

0,"Hi everyone - I'm hoping to get advice on a study strategy to achieve a 720+. After 7 months I can't seem to break past 600 and have completed 90%+ of TTP along with other commonly recommended resources (see below).  As you can imagine, I'm feeling very frustrated and burnt out. next official test is scheduled for 11/21 so I'm hoping I can salvage this application cycle and achieve at least a 700 then.  Highlights** I took a MGMAT CAT in Jan 2020 to gauge my starting place and scored a 460 (Q27, V27).
* Starting in early April 2020 studying 15-20 hours per week every week since then 
* I took my first official attempt in Sept 2020 and got a **570 (Q40, V28)**
* My best individual Quant and Verbal scores are Q40 (Official Test) and V34 (Official Mock). So if we superscore (I know the GMAT doesn't work like this, but let's just say as an estimation of my max performance) that is about a **610** at best.
* Math has always been my weakest subject. I'm a native English speaker and consider myself an avid reader (if that helps) so the Verbal struggles are frustrating as well 
* I'd say my studying has been about 75% Quant and 25% Verbal in terms of time allocation started TTP in early April of this year and am aiming for a 720+ score. I was hoping to achieve my target score by the end of Oct 2020 so I can meet Round 2 deadlines for the Class of 2023 (early January 2021 deadlines), but now that is looking ambitious. I was supposed to take my 2nd attempt this week, but cancelled it because my practice scores are not where I want them to be.  I found that my Quant accuracy is \~90%-100% for easy and medium tests when doing them untimed (which is the majority of my practice).  I attempt to do timed Quant tests/drills my accuracy drops significantly even for the easy and medium questions I typically know how to do. I've seen common advice to first focus on untimed problems and then timing comes naturally, but that approach does not seem to be effective for me. I fall apart under timed conditions even for problems I usually know how to solve.  Used**  TTP for my Quant studies. Have done a few GMATClub Quant CATs and question drills in the past weeks. My target score is set to the Q46 - Q48 range (it was set to Q47+ plus before TTP added more advances stuff and added the Expert+ range). 
* Completed TTP Verbal Beta modules and tests 
* I've watched the entire series of GMATNinja SC videos 
* Read the entire PowerScore CR Bible

|:-|:-|:-|
|680 (Q47 V36)|680 (Q46 V38)|720 (Q50 V38)| grudgingly started my GMAT prep back in Dec 2019. I enrolled in the Magoosh prep course. Magoosh was useful for basics but that's about it. my 2nd attempt in Jan, I had already exhausted all of the Magoosh questions with no improvement in score. I was also practising questions from the OG but I had plateaued in terms of prep. I knew I'd benefit from a 700+ but didn't have a target score per se. With Round 1 deadlines approaching and equipped with tips from this subreddit, I bootcamp-ed from the 2nd week of September and got a 720 today. Here are the things I learnt:- Get at least one diagnostic test done before you commit to a prep strategy. If I had gotten a diagnostic done, I would've strategised better. Simple.
2. **Dedicate enough time for prep.** Depending on your situation and standardised test abilities, prep can take anywhere from 2-36 months. Gauge that and be honest with yourself. If you're applying for Fall '22, start prepping right now. Seriously. Unexpected things happen. If you're done early, great. If not, you still end up with enough time. 
3. **Official GMAC questions should be the main source of your practice.** If you're just beginning your prep, you will be overwhelmed by all the offerings from prep companies. Nothing beats official GMAC questions. There's also a book for Advanced Questions! It's way more accurate, and I haven't found a better source for Verbal practice yet. It's better to give your money to GMAC rather than gamble on prep companies.
4. **Quant:** I keep hearing a lot about TTP for Quant. If you're not from a Quant background/weak in Quant regardless, I'd suggest getting a Quant baseline established through TTP at least 2 weeks after self-study/OG study. If you think you have the potential to improve in Quant, TTP sounds like a good road to take. However, if you're like me with decent Quant skills, and you don't have the money or time, GMATClub resources are great. Create a free account. The Manhattan Challenge Sets are amazing. I learnt a lot of new techniques in the past month alone. I would credit the GMATClub resources, including Bunuel's question set, with my Quant score improvement. 
5. **Verbal:** I was of the opinion that I couldn't possibly learn Verbal from YouTube videos. I was partly wrong because GMATNinja videos are great for approaching Verbal Reasoning questions. Highly recommend. I was scoring 40+ in my practice tests in the past week. Today I encountered really weird questions so I was a bit daunted, causing my score to not improve on paper. But I would still like to believe that my Verbal reasoning ability has improved :P
6. **For those struggling with mental health:** If you have the money, I would suggest using a tutoring service (GMATNinja, TTP, etc)  for accountability. Especially if you get distracted, anxious, etc or find self-paced prep difficult. It's better to spend money now than on reattempts, in my opinion. A less fanciful way would be to find a study buddy. That's what I did in the past month. Helped tremendously. GMAT prep is not one-size-fits-all. What works for 90% of test-takers may not work for you, and that's okay.
7. **Practice tests:** Buy the official GMAC tests. Magoosh started offering them at discount rates AFTER I purchased mine fml. If you have time for extra practice tests, Manhatten Prep is good for Quant because it's challenging. The others are pretty much the same. Remember the results are not accurate indicators of your performance on test day. Please don't flood this sub asking for our predictions. There are free ones as well but they're less similar to the real thing, in my experience (Magoosh, Kaplan, Veritas, MGMAT, and GMATClub).
8. Learn how to use GMATClub, and take everything said there with a pinch/handful of salt, as the case may be. Unofficial resources are not always accurate, especially for Verbal. They do more harm than good. I remember a prep company asking elaborate Indian curriculum Quant questions. Another had horrific SC questions. remember that contrary to what others tell you, you just need a GMAT score to be competitive enough for your target school. Not everyone wants to get into Harvard.

Now while I know how to get better at Quant with practice and avoiding silly mistakes, I am clueless on how to improve my CR. I have read the Manhattan CR guide twice, so I know the concepts and methodology. But I still cannot seem to push beyond a V32/33. I also faced a time shortage during the last 5-8 questions on both sections.

0,"Just want to share my score and thank the kind users on this subreddit for their advice and help on this absolute bitch of a test.  started studying right as the pandemic started and tested in August to unsatisfying results. I was getting 720-740 on my practice tests after going over the basics with the Manhattan and using GMATclub for additional questions. I came out with a 690 on the actual exam which was immeasurably disappointing. Chalked it up to unluckiness and getting hit with some of my weak sections. Scheduled a retake for a month later in person and spent the next 4 weeks spamming my problematic quant sections. Felt better this time around but still came out with only a 700 but perfect IR and essay so that was a silver lining.  then gathered what remaining energy I had left, ordered a score report to realize my geometry was weak. Spent 2 weeks doing all GMATclub hard questions then took the online test this weekend. I’m ecstatic with my score to say the least. Was starting to get really frustrated with GMAC and the format of the exam. By the end of my studying for the second in person, I was pulling 760 on practice tests so 60 points less on the test despite the practice exams being marketed as “similar difficulty to the actual exam” is honestly kind of bullshit.  online test didn’t feel much better in terms of difficulty to be honest. I was expecting a 720 but I will not complain in the slightest.  you’re reading this and not satisfied with your score, I’ll offer some advice besides the typical “just study harder and cover your weak spots ”.  to find something that shakes things up a little. For me, it was taking the online test at night in my own room and studying the day before despite all recommendations to avoid that. For my first two tests, I followed everything that was suggested as a best practice and that didn’t lead to optimal results. So just know that the ideal test taking circumstances for you could be different than the norm. Don’t be afraid to be bold. Don’t be afraid to guess. Maybe exercise beforehand.

0,"Hi everyone, as of today I am officially done with my 2 month GMAT journey and I would like to reflect on it. This sub has been an incredible source of motivation, encouragement and helpful study tips so all I can do is to add my two cents. things first - 16 days ago I got 640, which was significantly below my mock results (you can see my post with all the mock stats [here]( It was very discouraging. My main message to those of you whose first sitting didn't replicate the mocks - do not give up! First sitting is always funny and it is not a true reflection of your ability if your mocks were significantly higher score. sat GMAT three times between 21 August and 7 September: test centre - 21/8 - 640 (Q43/V35/IR8)  online - 27/8 - 690 (Q47/V38/IR6) test centre - 7/9 - 710 (Q48/V39/IR7) online reflections**  went well for me. The proctor spoke to me once, in the very beginning, when I clicked the ""chat"" button out of curiosity. It alerted the proctor instead of opening up a chat window. He then messaged me asking what's up and I told him I clicked the button in error. That's it. I got the results within 3 working days (sat the exam 4pm UK time Thursday, got results 11pm UK time Monday). Biggest tip - please run your system test well in advance, using the webcam you are planning to use during the exam. The exam itself did not feel any different to the test centre one test centre 640 to 710 - what changed** of all, I would like to thank Scott from TTP (u/Scott\_TargetTestPrep) - he responded to my initial post on r/GMAT with words of encouragement and then sent a follow up DM with the suggested plan of attack for revision. This did wonders to motivation - knowing that 640 is not what I should get. Honestly, TTP has been so much more than just a math resource that helped me get Q48 in the end. I read their strategy section, responses on various posts here and on GMATclub. They really do know their stuff and they really contribute to the community. I cannot recommend them enough and all I can do is to echo all the positive reviews you see on the internet.  you are planning to retake your GMAT, **I would strongly encourage you to get ESR (if you took your exam in centre, no ESR for online atm).** Before I got the ESR, I also reflected on what I thought went wrong the first time around. For quant, I knew I rushed the last 7 questions as I had something like 12 minutes left to do them. For verbal, I remembered not being thrilled with CR. This reflection helped shape my priorities for revision - and then when ESR came in, I knew I was completely right - for quant, I made 12 mistakes, 6 (!!!) of which were in the last quarter. For verbal, my RC and SC were above 85%, but CR was shocking.  my revision was specifically targeted at two things: for quant, it's knowing when to ""give up"" on a question and move on, being stricter with my time; for verbal, I just explored different CR techniques for different types of questions. I revised quite a bit ahead of my online exam, but after I got the results for that, I did absolute minimum - probably because I was close to the LBS average and I considered the score ""good enough"" - literally, I did not revise at all in the last week. Last night I did a GMAT mock number 5 (never did it before), just to ""warm up"" ahead of this morning. I do not recommend this as a revision technique, it's more of a mental exercise more than anything. Got 690 on the mock. else changed? I changed the order of the sections from AWA/IR/Q/V to Q/V/IR/AWA. I would recommend doing either Q or V first, whatever drains you the least - doing IR 3rd works as you will have just enough strength to care and get a decent score, knowing the hardest parts are behind you already. AWA can be written on autopilot, seriously. exams were taken at the same test centre at 8am, I made sure I ate this time and I think this also made a difference for me. It's the small things that matter.  I was already ok with having 690, so no matter what happened today I was fine with that - which probably meant I was very relaxed and wasn't as bothered about guessing on some of the questions.  I used** - TTP all the way.** I never thought I'd be able to score anything above 45 even if I studied for it. It  was so worth it, and reasonably priced too. I did the 5 day trial, expecting to move on to some other company's trial after that - but TTP was just so good, I just bought 1 month subscription and blitzed through it. I did NOT spend time on all of the chapters, I clicked through all of them, but I quickly knew (thanks to all the revision tests and diagnostics) where my weak areas were. I spent time mostly on those areas. **OG** was very helpful to track my progress, but I focused on PS questions mainly because if I knew how to solve something, it meant I would be able to work out which info I would/wouldn't need for a DS question. \- **GMATninja** for SC (early days of revision) and CR (after my first exam). I also found the **veritas prep and Manhattan free videos on YouTube** helpful for CR, as they teach you their approach to each type of question. I found these helpful.  - there was **a free video on Youtube by Manhattan** (it's like 8 years old I think, came out when IR first introduced). It is 1 hour long, looks at 4 types of questions that you can get on IR and gives you strategies to tackle each one. If you look at my mock results, I was really bad at IR for some reason and never got above 4 before I watched it. I then scored 8/6/7 in real exam, that was thanks to the video. \- honestly, I had 10 minutes on the bus to the test centre and I just looked at the **AWA guide on GMATclub**. There is a certain structure to the AWA essays, I just followed it - according to my ESR, my first attempt I maxed out all 4 elements of AWA so I'm guessing that would have been a 6.  do not give up, target your weak areas.

I’ve been enrolled to a coaching program from Manhattan Review, India for almost a month now. I paid INR 27,000/- ($370) for the online classes for all sections, and I can join any ongoing class of any batch for one year.  They also provided some of their own study material and OG 2019 with it. Classes are almost one on one, with a maximum of 3 students in an online class, which is great, and working for Verbal, but not Quant. I recently finished my Quant classes, and to be honest, I still don’t feel confident about concepts or strategies. I’ve watched a lot of GMAT club videos, and can see the difference in the teaching approach and the techniques compared to what I was taught. I’m sure even if I request for another class, the same trainer will teach the same stuff, in the same way, all over again. I could probably ask for another trainer, but my timings won’t match with that trainer. 
I’m planning on giving my GMAT by mid/end of October. Hoping to apply for 2021 fall intake. 
Considering the time I have, I’m now confused if I should consider taking the TTP Quant course for one month which is widely praised here, and spend another $100 (INR 7500) or if I should I stick to figuring out stuff on my own, with the same trainer and watch GMAT club videos alongside?
I haven’t taken a prep test yet, But I can my accuracy right now is around 60% for Quant. Mostly struggling with my basic approach, silly mistakes and time.

0,"So my GMAT journey started in early May. I’d just graduated from college (degree in economics) and needed something to do all summer before I started work in the fall, so I decided to try to get the exam done. started by taking a test completely cold (didn’t even know what data sufficiency questions were) on May 5th. Got a 610, 41V, 32Q. Most of the math concepts didn’t seem new to me, but I had just forgotten how to do them. So I started my study journey from there.
Due to the glowing reviews on here as well as other sites, I decided to go with TTP for the quant. Don’t want to sound like an ad, but the program was perfect for someone like me, who needed to relearn all the fundamentals for the quant section. I started moving through the chapters at a pretty fast pace for about 2 months, and then slowed down because I started feeling burnt out. TTP is LONG, and I ended up skipping half of the chapter tests for the last 3 chapters and not doing the universal reviews. But still, the chapter lessons were very thorough, and it was enough to get me comfortable with quant concepts again.
So my verbal advice might not be as helpful, because I started out with a pretty high floor. On my raw test, I got all of the CR and RC correct, but just made a lot of mistakes on SC. TTP verbal was launching at the time, so I decided to use that (I tried using a Manhattan book as well, but couldn’t focus with the PDF like how I could with the online module).  used the SC chapters to refresh my grammar skills, and they were all helpful. I think some of them were a bit more in depth than I required, but that’s fine I guess. I didn’t do any of the  SC chapter tests, so can’t speak to those.  also tried going through the CR sections. It was helpful for me to learn how to break down the argument into premises and conclusion, and understand what assumptions were (I previously was just going with whatever answer felt right). I wasn’t a fan of the CR chapter tests at all, they just felt way too hard, especially since I was doing great on the OG CR questions. So I didn’t do most of them, and I only went through about 3 of the CR chapters. 
My rundown for testing is as follows: test 1, May 6th: 610 - 32Q, 41V test 2, July 24th: 730 - 48Q, 42V (85% done with TTP quant at this point) test 3, August 21st: 730 - 48Q, 44V (was pretty disappointed, had finished TTP by this point) test 4, August 25th: 770 - 50Q, 47V (was a bit surprised. I actually only got 1 and 2 questions wrong on verbal and quant respectively, so I thought my score should’ve been a bit higher) test, August 30th: 760 - 49Q, 45V
(Was very happy, especially since this was my first attempt. Took it in person) tips 
I think the difference for me with pushing from 730 to 760 was two things:
1. Making sure I stayed alert and focused during the verbal. I had a tendency to zone out sometimes, especially on longer passages
2. Doing a lot more OG practice questions. As good as TTP is for learning concepts, the difficult questions there are very different than the difficult questions on the actual GMAT. The GMAT throws more curveballs with wording and trying to confuse you, where TTP difficult questions were largely due to difficult calculations and more math (to me). I had to focus on DS especially, which was always a bit of a weakness, and make sure I didn’t rush through them
 happy overall of course. Just started my job so glad I could get this out of the way, plan on applying in 3-4 years. The questions felt hard, particularly the verbal where there were several SC questions that had me confused and took more than 2 minutes. Thankfully it worked out and I got the score I wanted!",Success story: 610 - 760 in &lt;4 months,1598803843,12,821,1
0,"Hi all, sure this will benefit anyone, but I read quite a few of these debriefs during my studies and always enjoyed them, so I felt like I'd share my story. I'll try to keep it short, but feel free to ask me anything and I'll try to respond. information: I work full time as an engineer and also do some business development for a startup on the side. I'm lucky to not have kids, but having time to study was always my biggest constraint. As my work experience may hint, I graduated from an engineering program so have relatively decent quant skills, but my verbal was a major struggle. beginning**  about 5 months ago that I wanted to get an MBA to make a career pivot. I took a manhattan prep mock and got a 590 (Q42 V31). I knew I needed to improve but I had no idea where to start, so I started looking at debriefs online (much like this one) and tried to build a game plan. .. **A word of advice...** Please know that everyone is different (you included) and just because someone can learn one way, doesn't mean it will be the most optimal way for you. I made this mistake, seeing a post where someone got a 780 in 30 days and thought, why not me? I read his debrief and set out to complete the entire OG 2020 guide in 10 days and then just blitz mock exams. I'm sure many of you can guess, all this did was waste 10 days that I could have used studying. I took another mock exam and got a 600, not much better... realizing this method was not going to improve anything, I identified that I lacked the fundamentals to even begin running through official questions. I bought the complete set of **Manhattan Prep's** GMAT books and read each cover to cover. Like I mentioned, I work roughly 60 hours/week so I really needed to be creative about when I studied. really liked Manhattan's SC book, it really brought me up to speed on the fundamentals. The quant was decent, but I felt like they gave too much emphasis to brute force calculations, where I felt official GMAT questions focus more on your ability to manipulate questions to solve efficiently. story short-*** can see that my post is turning into a book so I'll break it down a bit faster and expand if anyone has any questions! about a month of self prep using both Manhattan Prep books, any Youtube videos I could find (**special emphasis on GMATNinja's videos**) and Veritas Prep mocks, I was scoring around the 700 mark. I took that as a good sign and scheduled an official exam. first exam was a bit of a shock when I received a 670.. I felt the burnout of my studied looming and decided to take a couple of weeks off. After returning I decided to try Target Test Prep, which I really enjoyed. It's a good resource if you want to break down the areas you need to improve and drill them continuously. biggest verbal improvement** honestly came from just reading more. I took some advice I read from a forum and found 2 articles each day from the economist that looked boring and dull and read them. This helped me withstand the dull articles GMAT tends to give you. additional tip that will not be for everybody** \- I had this idea that sounded dumb but actually really helped me. I videotaped myself taking a practice exam. I enunciated everything that went through my head during the exam and then rewatched it afterward. I was shocked to see how sporadic my brain was, I went at 100mph and let my thoughts get so disorganized. This really helped me take a chill pill. final Test*** days ago I took another in-person exam. The quant seemed **ridiculously** hard compared to any mock or my previous exam. I ran out of time and had to guess on the last two questions. The verbal went better than expected and I actually enjoyed it. my score flashed on the screen **770 (Q49 V46 IR8)** I was elated. love to help anyone if they have any questions.

I ended up with the same exact score all those months later and decided I needed to find a program and get serious.  Strictly TTP. I did the normal coursework to get that Q50/49 locked up and felt comfortable in quant completely. The custom tests available are amazing because you can run through some questions every day to remain sharp.  I knew this would be my weakness. Sentence correction was my biggest hurdle, so I used Erica Meltzer's book along with the condensed notes and did every SC in OG 2018, 2019, 2020. For RC and CR, I read the Manhattan guide just to understand the theory then once I understood, I used gmat club question bank to make sure I got some practice in. I did complete some portions of the TTP Verbal but honestly I had already committed to the other resources so I didn't get to use them to their full extent even though they are in beta. Day** I was extremely meticulous for my routine, down to the time I had my coffee, questions of prep I worked on to warm up, and the setup of my workstation. I signed in and had no issues getting ready. I found the verbal to be very easy and the quant to be extremely difficult. I ended up with a V38 and with no ESR, I was pretty dumbfounded. I decided to schedule my in-person for two weeks later and at worst, I would get an ESR and move on from there. Person: The in person experience was quite odd. I didn't practice on a notebook so that was interesting and I wasn't sure of the test center procedures which are extensive. Overall I found the verbal to be very difficult and the quant to be very easy. I will say that the breaks between each section are extremely helpful as I could go the bathroom and chug a coffee before I began each section.  quant, I only know TTP so I can't speak to others but TTP was the sole reason I scored so high in quant. I did the custom tests every day from March until the final test.  I can't recommend it enough as the material is all-encompassing but the interface is crucial to keeping your scores high. SC, I used Erica Meltzer's book, [GMAT SC Guide]( and every night re-read the [Meltzer]( spark notes. I would recommend reading her book or at least have it as a reference guide. The Manhattan Verbal guide is interchangeable with Meltzer's book but I found Manhattan to be like reading a textbook. used the app Elevate every day when I woke up.

I spent most of my time on quant, as that was clearly my weakness. I had never scored below a V38 cold. In 2019 I spent about 6 months pouring over the Manhattan quant books for 2+/- hours per day. I finally got my quant score up to a Q44.  sat for the real GMAT for the first time in August 2019 and scored a 710 (Q40/V45). I was happy that I broke the 700 mark on my first time taking the test, but I knew I could do better if I improved on quant.  the time a lot of folks had been preaching TTP on r/GMAT, so I signed up and studied for about 3 weeks and took the test for a second time in September 2019. I scored a 700 (Q45/V40).  knew for sure at this point that quant was my weakness. I decided to start spending the majority of my time studying quant with TTP. I spent a few (more than a few) hundred bucks on TTP between December 2019 and now. Around May 2020 I started taking the official GMAT practice tests I hadn't taken yet.  Prep #3: 760 (Q49/V44) Prep #4: 760 (Q50/V42) Prep #5: 770 (Q49/V47) thought it was time for me to re-take the official test. I scheduled two dates far out in advance (July 28th, 2020 and August 15th, 2020). Then I decided to schedule an online GMAT just to see how I would do, and to give me some breathing room in case I bombed on the two in-person tests.  took the online test in late June 2020. I scored 740 (Q49/V42/IR6). I was thrilled with a 740, but the IR was bothering me and I thought I could break the 750 mark if I took it again and didn't mess up on Verbal (I had done much better than V42 on past official and practice GMATs). 28th, 2020** was a day of reckoning for me. I had to drive about one hour to get to the test center because availability was limited due to COVID. I showed up on time after a stressful, rainy. and thunder-filled drive and started with Verbal first.  I was about four questions in when the center had a black-out due to the thunderstorm. My computer was obviously off and I waited about 15 minutes to get my test back up and running.  ended up with a  690 (V44/Q40). 50 points lower than my online GMAT and *80* points lower than my best practice GMAT. I was just relieved to have another shot already scheduled on August 15th.  15h, 2020** this point I had resigned myself to applying with my 740 (Q49/V42/IR6). At the end of the day, the 740 was a great score and one that would do me fine to get into b-school. *But,* I finished undegrad with a low GPA so I wanted to do everything I could to make up for that when applying for business school.  sat for the test on August 15th and, given that I was fine with applying with the 740, it felt like the lowest pressure official test I had ever sat for. My mental state was similar to when I had sat for practice tests in the past.  worked through quant and ran into some questions that gave me a little trouble, but I felt confident finishing. Same story with verbal - felt that I had done well, but I felt there were a few questions that I could have gotten had I spent a little more time (I panicked toward the end and guessed on a CR question that, in hindsight, I had more time to spend on than I thought I had at the time).  finished AWA and up popped a 750 (Q49/V44/IR8). To be honest, I was a little pissed that I didn't get a 760 with the Q49/V44 break-down (many have gotten a 760 with the same break-down), but then I realized that a 750 is good enough to make me a competitive applicant for any school that I realistically want to get admittance to and I was thrilled.  is a god-send for quant. Manhattan was fine for the basics, but even after I had worked through TTP I went back to do some of the Manhattan Advanced Quant questions (much harder than real GMAT questions, imo) and I realized that the explanations Manhattan offers are, compared to TTP, absolutely terrible at actually explaining the concepts underlying the questions.  pretty confident I wouldn't have been able to score a Q49 (Q50 practice) without TTP. It was the best money I've spent in terms of GMAT prep.  Verbal, I would recommend spending time to understand the SC concepts that the GMAT tests. In my personal experience, the RC and CR can be mastered through practice questions and understanding what exactly the GMAT is looking for in terms of answers. There are usually 3 very wrong questions for each CR/RC question, and two that are close to right.

0,"   writing this post for all the people out there that are in the middle of their studies and are questioning whether or not they can actually reach their GMAT goal. I’m writing this for people who’s practice tests scores are going down despite putting months into their studies. I want you to know that you can do it. You can do it because I experienced all of this and i did it. not a genius. I’m not one of these people on this reddit posting about how they are annoyed that they keep scoring 700+ on the gmat but on their practice tests they are scoring 770s. I’m just a dude who wanted to score at least a 700 after scoring at the 50th percentile on his first couple practice tests and was dumb enough to commit to the process necessary to get there. background info is I’m a 26 year old engineer based in Florida. Graduated from a decent college with a mediocre GPA, nothing fancy. a year ago I decided that, because I eventually want to start my own company, I might as well get an MBA. First things first was tackling the gmat. I knew I wouldn’t be applying for at least two years I knew I had plenty of time to prepare; this turned out to be both a blessing and a curse. first piece of advice is to not put the test off any longer then you have to. You can take the dang thing five times in a 12 month period so put your two-three months in of studying and take the stupid thing. Don’t be put off by your score if you don’t do as well as you would like, just use that as a tool to focus your studies for the next time you take it. Drawing it out longer than necessary will just waster your time, a lesson I unfortunately learned. how did I study? chose to start out with self studies using the OG guide books and some Manhattan prep books and over the course of six months (again don’t wait as long as I did) and fought my way out of the 580-610 range I repeated scores in to a 640 on my first GMAT test. was stoked But wanted to do better so I studied some more and on the next test I took a month later I dropped back to a 610.  I decided it was time to get serious and signed up for an online test prep course from Veritas Prep. Studied with them for about two months (saw a huge increase of my Quant score, highly recommend Veritas if you are struggling with Quant) and the. took the test again and scored a 690.  I was so close to my goal of 700 I committed to another month of studying, took the test again around April and got a 660.  was a pretty low point in my studies and where I began to seriously doubt if I would ever break 700. Understand that this may happen to you at some point in your studies and you just have to either give up or commit to powering through. I would suggest the latter of the two.  was right about the time COVID was jacking everything up so I decided I was going to take a month off from studying and try and readjust my perspective On the GMAT before jumping back into the test. is where I saw the biggest boost in my score: after not studying for over a month I came back to the practice tests and started scoring consistently 710-720. jump and all the previous jumps in my score from 580 to 640 to 690 to finally 740 came after I took a step back from the test and reevaluated my approach.  hear all these corny sayings about how the test is a “reasoning” test and how it’s called verbal “reasoning”. If you want to succeed at the gmat you need to take that to heart. Stop trying to solve everything and just start thinking about the questions. quant questions, If you think about it and see an approach work it out. If you are looking at the question and don’t know what to do skip that sucker. You will be amazed at how much your score will improve once you commit to skipping more questions you don’t know. After the exam use your error log to come back and learn the correct approach to what you guessed on but during the test throw them away immediately. No point in wasting your time. You need to be able to comfortable reason your way through what the question is asking before you ever have a hope of answering the question correctly.  verbal (where I struggled the most personally) my biggest gains came after I said screw it with all the crazy grammar rules and idioms and focused solely on meaning. You will be surprised how much easier SC questions become after taking this approach. Obviously if you miss a question come back and track it with your error log and figure out why. For CR I used a similar approach by focusing on the arguments conclusion. If you can accurately identify the conclusion of the argument and then link what premises are tied to it, you have the tools to solve the problem. You just have to take a step back and logically reason your way through the argument. know all of this is easier said than done, and I know a lot of you that read this will say you have already done this but all I can say is keep trying. Forget learning every little nuances. Focus on learning the core tools for each section and then just approach every problem with the bigger picture in mind. Be comfortable with not knowing everything. yeah I just wanted to let you know that you aren’t alone out there. Keep putting the time in, and focus on the reasoning aspect of the test and it will all come to you. Keep pushing, I know you can do it because I did it. wanted to write this because when I was struggling I would occasionally come to this sub reddit and look for a story that would make me believe it was actually possible.

0,"Reddit, been lurking this subreddit for motivation and tips / tricks and wanted to share my journey with ya'll. Line:** Math (TTP) and SC are learnable. If you memorize the rules and drill a ton, you'll develop the pattern recognition to recognize the concepts at a quick glance, which will make the test and your time management more manageable. I took the online test with the physical whiteboard which was a pretty seamless experience. However, I had to wait 9 calendar days for results, which was not fun. I under-studied for Verbal, despite knowing that I had more ""upside"" in that category. I enjoyed the positive feedback of mastering math and SC questions and probably didn't manage my study time well enough. I probably slightly underperformed on Verbal and bombed IR, but good enough. Humanities / economics undergrad, most advanced math class I took was Calc 1. Took the GMAT ~5 years ago and scored a 720 (47Q, 41V). I used Manhattan Prep (the full $$$ live-action course) and supplemented with OG questions then. and Cost** OG 2020
* OG Verbal 2020
* OG Advanced 2020 (I used only Verbal. Math was frankly too hard and TTP was sufficient practice)
* OG eLearning app - free with OG books. Great for Verbal, can customize the question type (CR/RC/SC), difficulty, and length of problem set
* Target Test Prep Math - $300 (5/5 helpful - $100 for 3 months)
* Erica Meltzer Sentence Correction book: $18 (4/5 helpful, need the OG and OG Verbal)
* Kaplan 800 book: $20 (2/5 helpful - gives you some neat tricks, but not concepts)
* Manhattan Prep Practice Tests and problem bank: $75 (1/5 helpful - tests not very representative, question banks not differentiated from the OG test on the Wiley website/app) I started studying 3 months ago. I had a decent GMAT foundation from having taken the test 5 years ago. I knew that I wanted to apply Round 1, so I put a lot of [unhelpful] pressure on myself to jam through the GMAT by the mid-summer so that I could focus on the essays and rest of my application.  started off with the Kaplan 800 book and the Manhattan tests / problem banks. In retrospect, neither of these were particularly helpful. I initially set a goal of taking a practice test a week so that I could gauge my progress weekly. This was also unhelpful from a preparation standpoint, but it did increase my sense of urgency.  then made the jump to TTP after seeing the rave reviews and bought the Erica Meltzer SC book for Verbal. My plan was to rip through TTP Math, the SC book, and then cram CR/RC at the end of my prep (since those sections were less ""rule-based""). Math plan: I went through each chapter lesson plan (reading, doing the problems) and then generally skipped to the Hard questions. I think the Easy/Medium questions are great for building a foundation, but they aren't efficient if you are pressed for time. I personally thought that learning through trial and error in Hard questions (in some cases, a LOT of errors) was more effective than going through softballs. 4/10/20, MBA.com Official #1: 710 (45Q/41V)

5. 6/9/20, Manhattan 4: 740 (45Q/45V). I stopped doing Manhattan and weekly practice tests in general. Manhattan's math is way too hard. I doubled down on TTP Math and the Erica Meltzer SC book after this.
6. 6/23/20, Official #2: 740 (49Q/41V). This was my first test after completing the TTP course. I cut a few corners in TTP, namely the Statistics, Unit Conversion, Coordinate Geometry, and Formula Logic chapters. I thought these were fairly intuitive and wanted to spend my time on more meaty sections.
7. 7/4/20, Official #3: 760 (50Q/42V)
8. 7/9/20, Official #4: 740 (49Q/42V) Day, 7/17/20: 750 (50Q/41V/5IR)  While TTP is great, I probably spent a bit too much time smashing my head into combinatorics and probability to master concepts. There are a ton of ""Hard"" problems for these two chapters and it's very tempting to throw yourself at these problems for a couple days, but the ROI isn't that great. There are maybe 1-2 probability questions on the GMAT and my time was probably better spent drilling number properties and number theory, as these are much more represented

0,"Hey r/GMAT!  lurking reddit and this subreddit for a little while - would love to get some input as to what my GMAT journey / studies should look like moving forward, now that I've completed the baseline test.  the test relatively cold - did do a couple of things tho.  Read through the test format / some GMAT experience blogs.
* Signed up for the 5 day trial of TTP upon seeing reviews on the subreddit, but barely got started with the first quant module (It was long, and I ended up being busy). 
* Briefly went through the Exponent / Word Problem / Geometry chapter from the Foundation of Math book by Manhattan to remind myself of the rules. 
* Watched a Veritas prep video on Sentence Correction on Youtube (was titled everything you need to know about SC - caught my eye). 
* Read the first two chapters of Manhattan Sentence Correction. Didn't read up on CR or RC at all. took the exam in the following structure:  V &gt; Q &gt; IR &gt; AWA. following are my concerns prioritized.  **Verbal** felt ... *difficult*. Although it turned out okay -  couple of things jump out as points of concern: Time - definitely ended up rushing towards the end, got my last three questions wrong 
* SC - got many of my ""wasn't sure but here's my best guess"" questions correct, couldn't understand why or how I went about eliminating options. Don't really have a solid grasp on the rules of grammar. Felt like my weakest area.
* CR &amp; RC - wasn't too difficult, but felt like I had to rush through a few, and didn't have a tried-and-true process either (although I suppose it will come with time and practice).  **Quant** was not easy, but *hopefully* learnable.  Time - Again. Biggest struggle here was that digging up knowledge took most of my time. In combination with my stubbornness (didn't want to skip or guess on questions) - wasted a lot of time up front and rushed towards the end. 
* Conceptual Knowledge. DEFINITELY lack conceptual knowledge in some areas - permutations and combinations, to name one for sure. 
* DS - Data sufficiency questions were a struggle, felt uncertain about most of my answers in this area. My intuition is that this is linked at least in part to the lack of conceptual knowledge.  **Integrated Reasoning** (IR).  Looking at the broader test statistics, I can tell that IR4 is terrible - but I wasn't taking it seriously and was in a bit of a hurry to get to my GMAT score.  Will put in the time to familiarize myself with the section.  Steps** am by no means comfortable in Verbal (contrary to what the score may suggest) - would love to really work on this. Appreciate any resource suggestions.  my Quantitative score also feels rather low. I am considering subscribing to TTP, but as a non-US/UK undergrad, will have to save up a bit before I can afford to pull the trigger here (the exchange rate *really* kills me here). Any other resources I can / should leverage in the meantime?  to go through the test review tomorrow in more detail, analyse my answers and get a better understanding of what specifically I need to work on.  said - all of what I've wrote is based on my intuition and analysis. Would be great to hear from folks on the subreddit as to what I missed, what else I could / should work on, and what worked for you guys in addressing some of the concerns I've listed.

I had a tutor for some time in the beginning of the year but I didn’t think he was that great. I received a 510 which was probably deserving. just took the GMAT for the second time today and received a 510 AGAIN. Q33/V27/IR 5. I sobbed in my car for a good 30 minutes. I have been studying extremely hard and almost full time the last 2-3 months. I don’t understand how this is possible.

2) Ran through about 72% of math videos on Magoosh and 44% of verbal- not a fan of the SC videos but liked everything else
3) TTP equation sheet that is included in its package (15 pages) wrote flashcards for formulas from there for ones I thought were useful
4) Made flashcards for some SC points as well from Manhattan Prep strategy book
5) Kept error log for Q only; ran through error log and flashcards about every other day
6) Listened to “The GMAT strategy” podcast on Spotify; I listened to probably 12+ episodes during my drives or walks
7) Practiced in sets from OG 2019 book only: tried to do 15 problems a day with 5 problems varying from each area.. 5 for SC/5 DS/5CR for example a day. Didn’t time myself but felt I moved fast enough. Reviewed ones I didn’t get right.
8) Bought OG exams 3-6 and completed 1-5 (left 6 for a retake as needed). Honestly to be transparent my scores ranged from 570-760 so I really didn’t know how I would do on test day.
9) Biweekly study sessions with fellows
10) Didn’t exercise but meditated for 10 minutes a day since even before this process and continuing into it

0,"I took the GMAT four times and everytime it was better as I learnt what worked for me.  
 Attempt JULY 2019 (5 months of prep)**  
Mistake #1: prepared for it like any other test. Not the smartest way as I was focussed on ~~learning~~ mugging each concept. the Kaplan books to build my base (2 hours a weekday; 8 a weekend). Worked well for Quant. Thought nothing of Verbal then. Started the OG problems a month before the test. Used Kaplan mocks and #1#2 mocks from GMAC with a score bracket of 640-710 (Q44-51, V28-35)  
**REAL TEST: 640 (49Q/28V/IR8)**  
 Attempt SEPTEMBER 2019 ( 2 months of prep)**  
Mistake #2: focussed correctly on raising my verbal score. ~~Learnt~~  Mugged concepts from Manhattan Guides.   redid all possible OG (2019 and Verbal) without much regard to conceptual knowledge. Used Manhattan mocks and  #3 through #6 mocks from GMAC with a score bracket of 670-710 (Q49-50, V31-35)  
**REAL TEST: 700 (50Q/35V/IR7)**  
  3 FAILED APPLICATIONS LATER --\]  
 Attempt JUNE 2020 ( 3 months of prep)**  
Mistake #3: burned out by excessive studying ~~mugging~~ and didn't get any sleep before the test day. You can only do so much on coffee and sugar. sure I redid all possible OG (2019, Verbal and Advanced) and watched Thursdays with Ron for SC/CR . Used #1 through #6 mocks from GMAC with a score bracket of 700-760 (Q49-51, V35-44)  
**REAL TEST: 700 (50Q/35V/IR7)**  
 Attempt JULY 2020 (1 month of prep)**  
Following this sub's recommedations, I learnt through GMAT Ninja series on YouTube and purchased GMAT CR Bible.   
Surprise! Both resources said nothing new. Why should they? My preparation was lacking in quality not quantity. I honed my verbal basics.  SC is starightforward: look for meaning -&gt; verb agreement -&gt; parallelism -&gt; idioms. If I can't answer after these steps, I guess and move on. The result? 95% accuracy on 700+ (VeritasPrep and OG-Hard) SC questions  
* RC is all about concentration. I sat for all my practice tests with a clear mind and a glass full of water. Believe me when I say, RC is the easiest of the sections. I  read the passage in 2-3 minutes and took notes if I needed to. I come from a science background with a keen personal interest in history, so I focussed extra on art/literature based passages with complicated chain of thought and language. And it helped.
* CR is the toughest. I overthink everything-from why my partner didn't clean the dishes to maybe I am not worth the good things in life. The key to cracking CR is to not overthink. I would remove 3 choices during the first scan of the answers -irrelevant, inverse of what is asked, too extreme. The final two is where I used-what if this is not true?, is its inverse a possibility? Its not the cleanest way but it did give me a structured way to approach CR. I won't lie as I could only manage to get 78% on 700+ (VeritasPrep and OG-Hard) CR questions. But the psychological boost was good enough for me. spent many hours on OG problems (1, 2, Verbal and Advanced)    
I did not bother to raise my base score of 50 in Quant as I knew my overall score would greatly benefit from a Verbal increment. VertasPrep's mocks and question banks are legendary!

0,"Long-time lurker here, making a post because this community as been helpful in my journey so I want to contribute my experience. I am in my mid-20s and work in asset management on the east coast. I am not a test taking god, I got around a 1900 SAT back how many ever years ago just for reference. I've seen past posts of insane scores where those same people indicated that they've been receiving these elite scores on other standardized tests. I felt it's important that I mention I am not one of those people. I had taken the GMAT while in college because a friend of mine needed it for his Master's program and I knew I wanted to eventually get an MBA, so we studied together. I studied for around a month a few hours a day, familiarized myself with the test, and received a 650. One:** With Covid and basically my entire area being shut down, I decided now was the time to start studying and put this test behind me, whether I decide to apply to business school this cycle or next. I started by buying the **GMAT Official Guide 2020 Verbal and Quant** books around April. This was helpful to re-familiarize myself with GMAT content and curriculum. There really isn't much reading in these books, it's more questions and answers than anything, but this was my starting point. I got through these 2 books in about a month. Then I had a **Manhattan Prep** book on Advanced Quant laying around from the time I studied for the test back in college. I went through this as well, but honestly didn't feel like I got much out of it minus the 'testing smart numbers' strategy. I took a Mock Exam and received a 660/Q:44/V30-something (sorry don't remember and erased that score haha) and I knew this wasn't good enough for the schools I had been planning on applying to. Two:** After some honest self reflection and what I was willing to sacrifice for the test, I decided I would throw everything I had at it. This was around late May-Early June, and I was planning to apply this cycle beginning in September so I wanted to finish the test by mid-July so I could then focus on other parts of my application. I saw the reviews **Target Test Prep** had on here and on GMAT Club and I decided to do the free trial to see if it was the real deal. I can assure you, it is the real deal and instantly I knew this was what I needed. I have been working from home during covid, so I would literally wake up 2 hours earlier and study TTP and then study once I was done with work for the day. On weekends, I pretty much studied the entire day minus a golf outing or boat day or two. I got through the first 3 weeks with relative ease but then toward the end started to get burned out. I still forced through because I was committed to my mid-July timeline, but I would recommend giving yourself ample time to get through TTP and to reinforce the concepts in your head. Quant** \- Because I felt I was strong in certain areas of quant, I would only take the tests for these sections and review my wrong answers and read those appropriate sections of that chapter related to the problem. However, for some tougher sections for me personally like Combinations and Permutations and Geometry for example, I went through the entire chapter. I feel that the approach TTP uses made me incredibly prepared, and I was comfortable with every question I would eventually see on mocks and the actual exam as a result of this preparation, whereas in the past I would simply guess on certain topics and more difficult questions. Verbal** \- Although still in pre-beta. I read through all the SC and CR chapters and did all the questions. CR in particular kicked my ass in the beginning, I would literally get 20%'s on the hard quizzes. But it forced me to reassess how I approached these questions and look for what the GMAT was looking for. I can attest that it was incredibly helpful for me personally to go through the entirety of these chapters and review every wrong answer. Day Prep:** I bought all the OG Mocks and started to do them. I took 5 and my scores are below, as you can see there was some deviation between my scores, which made me nervous leading up to test day. I would review all my wrong answers and re study those sections on TTP related to those topics. I also did OG verbal questions from the Q bank provided by the verbal guide book. 1: 750 2: 710 3: 760 4: 710 5: 750 Week:** My test day was scheduled for saturday, I took my final mock the sunday before. I wasn't happy with my verbal which was a little suspect to me based on my Mock Exams. So I watched all the videos of GMAT Ninja on the GMAT Club youtube channel related to Verbal. I felt this was incredibly helpful as he would walk through his thinking and I found his approach of finding wrong answers then settling on a correct one to be really effective. This is a link to the videos I'm describing: [ Day:** I didn't study the night before and day of because I wanted to be fresh going into test day. I honestly felt the test was incredibly easy compared to the Mocks and I finished with alot of time to spare on each section. I don't know if this was a result of my prep or I got lucky or both, but I got the score I was looking for. Read GMAT Books and Manhattan Prep Advanced Quant, didn't cut it. Dove into TTP with everything I had, got the score I wanted and am relieved to be moving on. I'll try to answer some questions if anyone is interested.

I stopped studying about 2 days before the exam, and made sure to get adequate rest the night before.

I was right on pace, finishing with :30s left in the section. I was very deliberate about DS choices, and credit the OG problems with teaching me to be careful with spotting traps. I caught 3 separate traps and felt proud of myself by the end of this section. was... easy. I finished 15 minutes early, which freaked me out. I felt like I must've messed it up badly to finish so early. The structure of the section wasn't even one I liked. The first 7 questions were all SC, then a few CRs, then back-to-back RC passages, a mix, and finishing with the 3rd RC passage.  was a clear weak point for me. I had 4 minutes left with the last 2 questions (both equation-based) and chose to split time on each instead of solving 1.

I can't tell you why my GMAT actual was *demonstrably better* than any OG Mock I took. I think by the time I took it I had exposed myself to just about every trap/trick there was, and I was just ready for it in practice. I do believe I got lucky that the clearly hard questions in Quant were from sections I was very good at (ratios/word problems) instead of ones I struggle with (rates/work, which were easy on the exam).  think TTP worked well for me, but I don't think its for everyone. I was very discouraged at points by TTPs length and the Hard exams. Scoring a 55% on a Hard unit test was always painful. Further, by the end of my TTP prep (doing random E/M/H exams) I saw diminishing returns as I had seen the questions enough times that I often remembered the answer. Was TTP work the $600 I paid? I think so, but a dedicated person could pay a lot less and get the same results from GMAT Club / OG materials. took 2 weeks off in April and found a lot of June was spent half-heartedly studying.

Or should i solve daily 10-20 SC questions besides Quant and CR.   
I need to take the exam by 20/8.  
and I think by this performance I wont get the desired score.

Received my score earlier today (within 3 business days) and got a 760, which was my target score. The test hadn't gone as smoothly as I had hoped and hence I though it might dip to 740-750, hence was happy when I saw the score. Used:** Manhattan SC for basics of sentence correction
2. Magoosh premium
3. Egmat's verbal course
4. GMAT Official Guide
5. Gmatclub question bank 
6. Gmatninja's videos for RC and CR approach on Resources:** terms of preparation, I spent 90%+ of my time on verbal as I was very comfortable with quant. Among verbal sections, I spent 60%+ time on Sentence correction. Had decided this time allocation post my first Gmatprep mock, which I had given cold. Manhattan is a very good source to provide the initial foundation for SC. Used Egmat for increasing SC accuracy. Before using Egmat i was reading less for meaning and relying a bit more than I should on my ear, which is not very reliable on 700+ difficulty questions especially if you are a non-native speaker. Egmat helps refine the process you use when solving SC problems by focusing more on the meaning of the sentence (hard to develop by yourself) and following a methodical approach. Magoosh was helpful for the good quality question bank (with video solutions) and the Idiom flashcards.  Gmatninja videos were very helpful for me especially for RC. In RC I initially had a no-notes approach which actually wasn't working that well for me. I found that I was missing some elements of the passage as taking no notes increases the likelihood of the reader skimming the passage. I then shifted to note taking (on my physical whiteboard) which increased my accuracy somewhat. However, I still was missing some of the difficult 'structure-based' and inference questions as I ended up focusing more on taking detailed notes rather than understanding the structure and overall purpose of the passage. Watching Gmatninja's videos was helpful in refining the way I take notes and absorb the overall purpose and structure of the passage. For CR, i skimmed through the Manhattan CR guide and watched E-gmat's videos to refine my approach. In terms of questions, I mainly solved OG questions (especially those with 700+ difficulty). If I had more time, I would have definitely solved LSAT questions to further increase my accuracy. not recommend this to everyone but the reason I used multiple resources before giving the online exam as the city I am living in has both of its test centers closed (at least until August) because of lockdown. So giving the online gmat was the only option for me to get adequate time post the GMAT to focus on my R1 applications. Wanted to be doubly sure of my preparation because there is only one permitted attempt (I think this is slightly unfair especially for those in cities without active test centers).  the exam day I was getting 90%+ accuracy across verbal sections in the Gmatclub 600-700 difficulty questions and 85%+ accuracy in the 700 difficulty questions, which gave me the confidence to attempt the exam. Day Experience;** Quant: Surprisingly I got a difficult DS question right upfront (not sure if this is because it was experimental). It didn't click immediately so I ended up spending 5 minutes on this question before moving on to the next one. I got a string of 8-10 easy problems post that before the problems started getting more difficult. I know i tripped up on one difficult geometry DS question (got caught in the trap) which kind of unsettled me. But thankfully got a Q51 in the end, which implies that I probably got either no questions or 1 question wrong apart from that one.
2. Verbal: got a very difficult RC passage upfront (more difficult than all those i encountered in the Gmatprep mocks and OG 700+ passages) in which I likely got a couple wrong. I think this is what led to my score reducing to a V41 as the rest of my verbal section went smoothly (except one question on CR towards the end which I think I misread).
3. Proctor interaction: I was contacted twice by the proctor. Once to inform me that my head was slightly out of frame and another time to inform me that I shouldn't put my hand on my face (this is a habit of mine). However, these interactions were quick so didn't take much of my time. Summary:** Mock 1 (May 23): 710 (Q51 V35) Gave this one cold to decide strategy Mock 2 (May 29): 750 (Q51 V39) This one was after completing  Mock 3 (June 6): 760 (Q50 V44) Missed one easy question on quant due to a DS trap; made it a point to check the easy quant questions more properly post this attempt. Mock 4 (June 13): 750 (Q51 V39) This verbal score drop was driven by poor time management in the verbal section (because of too much note taking in RC) due to which accuracy dropped in the end.  Pacing strategy is important: give as many verbal mocks as you can to ensure you can consistently complete the verbal section while not compromising on accuracy. My strategy was to spend 20 minutes on the first 10 questions, then pace up in the middle so that I am not crunched for time in the end.  Mock 5 (June 20): 760 (Q51 V41) Made several errors on SC here especially in verb, modifier, and parallelism related SC problems. Post this, I signed up for eGMAT's course. Mock 6 (July 12): V44  Mock 6 was given after completing eGMAT's SC and CR course and Gmatninja's videos. Did not attempt quant section due to shortage of time.

0,"Hi r/GMAT let me thank you all for all the resourceful and great advice in this forum. I started preparing for my exam in early march but really did not get into it till mid April. I have been taking regular practice tests to acquire a habit of sitting down and drilling my brain for 3-4 hours straight (never was a  good exam taker). Here are my mock test results:

 unofficial score in the real exam today was: Q49 V39 IR7 and 710 overall. exams are way tougher than the real thing and I feel, they are good for practising but do not represent your real level. If you are not easily demotivated, then i would advice you buy the set of six for practice.  you can see i was scoring consistently around 650 after my initial blind exam.  was generally OK at quant and was not really worried about it much. I just practiced 30 questions from 600+ difficulty every other night. Never studied theory wise. before my initial date for exam i took a final exam( See test 10) from Gmat Prep exams and scored 690 which was a touch below my desired score. you can see verbal was my Achilles' heal. I analysed all my exams properly and realised, my accuracy in RC and CR was acceptable but my SC was below 50%, which was taking my score down by 5 points. So i deferred my exam for two weeks and started working on my SC. I referred Manhattan SC book for theory and Gmat Club questions for practice. I also kept a detailed error log of every new concept i encountered and learnt from it. Slowly but surely my accuracy improved and 3 days before my rescheduled exam, i took another practice test(Test 3) from Gmat and scored way above my expectations at 750. I knew this might be an inflated score because maybe i got easier questions. I took another exam the very next day and score a solid 740 again. I was confident this time that i will break the 700 barrier in the real thing.  night before the exam, i contracted a splitting headache, which did not allow me to get a good night sleep(did not want to take any medicine for sleep as I did not wanted to be drugged and sleepy during my exam as my exam was scheduled for 8AM). During quant section i messed up couple of easy questions(like i knew i marked the wrong in DS right as clicked next). Verbal went ok but not as well as i had expected.  be honest i was relieved to see my score as i was dreading a 650-680 score. i am sure if i would have been in perfect condition i could have scored around 730 but i am happy with my 710. advice to anyone who is preparing and is stuck at the same score is to keep an error log and you will find that you are usually getting the same error in every test. So just focus on that aspect for week or two and that will improve your score dramatically. and good luck.",From 610 to 710 in 4 months,1594930543,7,577,1

I have been preparing for GMAT since last 4 months and  have used up all GMAT tests. my scores have hovered around 700 in official prep tests,~680 in Veritas and 640 in Manhattan prep
Verbal is my weak area, and my weak section has varied from test to test, I have referred GMAT ninja videos and Manhattan guide for SC, cr bibal and GMAT club resource for CR
In every test I give, I run out of time and end up guessing in last 3-4 questions(sometimes more), but the lag in time in last 10 or so questions starts taking a toll on my accuracy
I overshoot time in RC and CR primarily
Though I use the time grid to gauge my pacing after every 5 questions, I have not been able to course correct when I realise that I am running short of time
1. How to chose question to guess and move on when you know you need to speed up( I mean I need to read the entire CR stem to know if it's a question worth guessing, which will end up taking around 1-1.5 min) If I see that I am lagging in time, should I pace a little to compensate, should I blindly guess on the the next question and move on, or let the lag pile up and guess on last few questions

I know my score isn’t all that high, but I’m proud of it and it’s gotten me into all the schools I applied to.  me: 30 year old born and raised in the US. Been in sales since graduating in 2012. Undergrad was science based, but not very technical or math heavy. &lt;3.0gpa.  TTP is great. I started using it before my second exam, but didn’t make it all the way through. I did wind up completing it before my third and final exam. I don’t think you need TTP if you are disciplined in using a study plan that incorporates the OG, but I like logging on and seeing exactly what I need to do.  wish I would have had more time to really dig into my error log for questions where there was a knowledge gap, or drill some questions where I made a careless mistake. As others have said supplementing with OG questions for specific types of quant problems and using your error log for review is key. I think I could have started scoring consistently in the 49-50 range with just another 3-4 weeks of studying.  I thought the Manhattan books were great, and Magoosh videos were helpful as well. I went from finishing verbal with 15 minutes left on the first few practice CATs I took, to running out of time on my last exam and guessing on the last three RC questions. For that reason time management is important, but you also have to realize when you lose focus, and have a way to get back on track.  many others my verbal score was all over the place. I found that if I had any persistent noise distract me while taking a CAT, then I could not focus. Of course on my last exam I got a super dense RC passage and I could hear my neighbors kid talking on the phone through my apartment wall. I was also freaked out about mouthing verbal questions while reading them. Looking back I don’t think my proctor would have cared and I should have done that since it’s how I practiced.  things that helped me with verbal were identifying splits for SC, writing notes on RC (just enough to remember arguments, or names), and for CR reading the question slowly to make sure you know what they are looking for.  this post is horribly written, I apologize, but I’m real tired.

Breakdown:
-Total: 690 (85th percentile)
-Quant: 43 (46th percentile)
-Verbal: 41 (94th percentile)
-Integrated Reasoning: 5 (52nd percentile) I prepared** Quant, I used TTP to learn and practice the concepts. I reviewed flash cards every day. I did timed practice sets with OG 2019 (10 questions, 20 minutes). My weak areas are number properties, work problems, and probability so I practiced them in TTP leading up to the exam. For Verbal, I relied only on OG 2019 to do practice sets (again 10 questions, 20 minutes except for SC which was 10 questions, 15 minutes). I kept an error log during my question sets and reviewed my mistakes. I took a full length practice exam before I started studying last December and scored a 600. I did not take any full length practice exams after that.  Day (I wrote the following 15 mins after finishing my exam as a retrospective.)**  pace - although I finished every single section in time. I had no sense of time during each section. I spent what felt like a lot of time on a few questions but not too much time as to retract from others. If I was getting nowhere in 3 mins, I guessed and moved on.  - Number properties is the hardest part. On a few questions (related to possible values of x), I had to try a few numbers, draw conclusions, and move on but I didn't feel like I was 100% sure. Work problems were unexpectedly hard. Had to guess on 2 work problems (1 PS and 1 DS). I was pretty aggressive in my guessing strategy. Overall, I feel like I didn't get to the hard questions so not expecting a high raw score here.  - SC and RC were manageable. I got stumped on a couple RC and SC but made best guesses. CR was challenging towards the end and in general. Overall, I spent more than average on CR questions. I wrote the conclusion in my own words for each CR in my notes and tried to use that to solve the problem but still found it difficult. Again, I didn't feel like I got difficult questions so not expecting a high score.  score: 640 Plan** Increase score by 30-50 points to 720-740 My next exam is an in-person exam scheduled on September 1.

I started studying nine months ago, since I work full-time. I studied a couple of hours a day using Kaplan's book and various Youtube resources. I ripped some shitty copies of the Manhattan books online, but they were scanned and unappealing, and I got them too late, so I mostly relied on Kaplan. Did two unofficial diagnostic tests, but I listened to people in this forums that the official practice tests are the most relevant and the score is most reflective to that of the real exam. I did my first practice exam at the end of May, and was pleasantly surprised with my score. I only needed a 600, and a 690 score was more than enough. The latter tests seemingly proved that I was ready to do the actual test, so I booked it.   
 day:** Didn't feel particularly nervous, since my practice tests showed I was able to perform drastically better than what's required for my uni. Took it at a test center in my city. Thought the test went more or less exactly as a practice test, and didn't feel that the quant (obviously being the main problem) questions were any easier or harder than what I practiced. Verbal too. So I just assumed that I would get about the same score. I didn't even care if I got a lower score. I was devastated. I still feel that way. I have absolutely no idea how it happened, **especially since I took my last practice test literally a day before the test, and got a 670**.  can't get out of bed, I can't eat, I can't go through a day without crying. I've been seeing my shrink every day since this happened. I live in a country where almost nobody takes the GMAT, this forum is the only place I can ask **questions**, and hope for honest answers. can someone please tell me: How did this happen? How did my score get so low on the actual test?
* Are the practice tests, especially the quant tests, unrepresentative of the actual test? 
* Is it a big conspiracy?
* How long should I wait until I begin studying again? How long should I wait until I retake the test?
* How should I study for the retake? know you guys can't help me with my emotional state, but since everyone here aims for the stars (in terms of GMAT, at least), please tell me how should I approach my next attempt at the GMAT.",How?,1593023967,2,593,1

0,"Its been a while that I wanted to take gmat but was unable to because of my professional commitments. Finally, I decided 3 months back that I want to get over it. Initially I started with Manhattan Quant and Verbal guides to kick start my study. Manhattan guides are good but they dont go into much detail. I was looking for a course that provides more detail as I was not doing good in couple of quant topics. I went to the gmat club and scrolled through reviews of different gmat courses. I saw impressive reviews of TTP course in the quant and instantly decided to try it.  I took the 5 day trial of TTP course by paying $1. I was very impressed with the course as it was exactly what I wanted. As the trial expired, I bought the Flexible Gmat prep package of TTP. The course is designed in such a manner that it will help you study in the guided manner. The course literally forces you to study and put in hours to learn and improve your quant score. The course goes into a lot of detail. Almost every topic tested in gmat is covered in the course. One of the major advantage of the course is that you get a lot of questions to practice from. After every topic you  study,  have to take quizzes for that specific area of study, which helps in consolidating the things learned. The questions are great for doing practice and you can also make custom tests for specific topic with the easy, medium or hard questions option of the issue with the TTP course is that it is way too long. It takes atleast 2 months to finish because of the way it is designed and the depth it covers. I have completed my course and am in the process of doing revision and solving question provided by TTP and official guide. reason for writing this post was to help anyone, who is struggling with quant and wanted a well structured and detailed course, which could help him or her.

I believed the reading passages were in my favor because 3 out of 4 were short and easily digestible for me. I never received higher than a 710 or a 36V before this and I feel the 760 was very fluky. However, since I did both exams, when i restarted them, the next practice exams had a decent number of questions that I did previously on both verbal and quant, so my score turned up 760 again (50Q, 42V).

0,"Hi everyone, I just took the online GMAT on 6/05 and got my score back today. I just wanted to briefly work through my process in case it might help someone else. I started studying 5/17 and did about 3 hours a day every day until test day but took one day off per week. I studied CS in undergrad. I have also taken the MCAT before. I wasn't taking one of the GMAT official practice exams, I either was reviewing every single question from the practice exam or doing some of the GMAT official practice questions. I kept a spreadsheet called ""Why I Missed It"" where I wrote down every mistake or less-than-crystal-clear concept and reviewed this info regularly. This is also where patterns would emerge about concepts I consistently missed, like job/rate problems on quant, parallelism in sentence correction, dissecting arguments in verbal, long passages in IR, etc. Especially for quant, this was crucial because before I started studying I completely forgot certain unit circle, job/rate, and interest formulas that came up often.  I took the Online GMAT, I made sure to practice with the online whiteboard every single day during prep. I only used the whiteboard during the quant or IR sections and for the majority of my prep didn't have an external mouse (so I used a trackpad). I got really annoyed by the trackpad and desperately wanted paper and pencil, but once I finally got an external mouse, the online whiteboard didn't bother me as much. Since the online GMAT is now allowing a physical whiteboard, this advice is obsolete.  saw a lot on this sub about TTP and Manhattan Prep and was really confused; I just thought that doing material from the GMAC would be best because they made the real test. I was quite pleased with the official practice questions and practice exams (even though they were pricy).  were the concepts that I struggled with most and how I approached them during prep: Prime Factorization, Multiples, Divisors for Data Sufficiency: Really hard for me unless I had that Eureka! insight moment. I found that doing a little bit of trial-and-error and seeing where certain rules would mess up allowed me to see patterns or just brute force through the question. This was pretty helpful for most data sufficiency questions.
2. Job/Rate and Interest Problems: Just had to practice enough with the formulas so that I memorized them
3. Taking too long with arithmetic: Especially with the online whiteboard slowing me down, I would sometimes spend 5+ minutes on a single question with lots of tedious arithmetic. I learned that if this type of a question came up, there was probably a shortcut that could be used to avoid that work; I just had to see it. Critical Reasoning and Dissecting Arguments: These were hit-or-miss for me because I would often pick the red herring options that ""sounded right"" but never really answered the question. I learned that ""pick the option that weakens"" X often means pick the option that would weaken the argument *even in the slightest*. In addition, the option should directly impact the argument in some way, even if it isn't intuitive. 
2. Sentence Correction: This was pretty helpful: [ Seeing patterns about parallelism, verb/subject agreement, etc. made it click more. Also learning to get over the urge to pick the option that ""sounds"" right was crucial. Surprisingly, reading comprehension was more straightforward for me, which on previous standardized tests always got me. IR was the epitome of hot or cold. You could see from my practice tests that I'd either score 4/5 or 8. This was mainly me getting caught up on one particular question/passage and ending up wasting 10 minutes. I learned how to force myself to go faster on certain questions, especially ""passage"" type questions with multiple tabs. Graphs and arithmetic questions were most straightforward, but others always got me. I just made sure to pound IR questions from the official practice questions and honestly, hope for the best. practice exam scores were: Official Practice Test #1 (700 \[IS 5, 55%, Q 47, 63%, V 39, 89%\] Official Practice Test #2 (780 \[IS 8, 93%, Q 49, 75%, V 49, 99%\] Official Practice Test #3 (730 \[IS 8, 93%, Q 49, 75%, V 39, 89%\] Official Practice Test #4 (760 \[IS 4, 40%, Q 49, 75%, V 46, 99%\] Official Practice Test #5 (760 \[IS 8, 93%, Q 50, 83%, V 44, 98%\] Official Practice Test #6 (780 \[IS 8, 93%, Q 50, 86%, V 47, 98%\] Online Exam: **770, 99% (Q 51, 96%, V 44, 98%, IR 8, 92%)** understand my prep experience was a little different than most people, but hopefully this can help someone else.","Debrief Online GMAT 770 (51Q, 44V, 8IR)",1592347014,11,984,1

0," About one year ago I decided to take the GMAT to make it into my desired master's program which is International Management at Tilburg  University in the Netherlands. In October 2019 I started studying for about 10-15h per week and continued to do so until December. The last 2  weeks before my .exam I studied full time. I took two practice tests during that time and since I scored 540 on the first and 570 on the second, I was not really expecting to actually make the 600 on test day.  On December 28 I took my first Gmat attempt and I scored 590 (Q:38  V:34). It went better than expected, I felt that my concentration that day was just on point. I decided immediately that I want to give it another shot since I'm so close to my goal.   
I felt like I should focus more on math since my verbal score seemed to be solid. In the end, I ended up buying the [Magoosh](  GMAT package because it offers you a 50 point score increase guarantee.  I couldn't study for the GMAT in January and February because I had to take exams but I started again in March and planned a second attempt in  May. I worked through everything in that [Magoosh]( prep course, I watched every video and I did all the practice questions they offer. Because of Corona, the test centers were closed in May and after reading the bad experiences with the online whiteboard I didn't dare to take the online GMAT. At the end of May I took a prep test from  Manhattan and scored 590 (Q:42 V:31). Since I had technical problems during verbal which made me lose 5 min of my test time, I didn't worry too much about my drop in that score and was happy about my increase in quant. I felt ready to take the test for the second time.  
2 days ago  the test day came and I felt confident that I'll get those 600 points that day. I was definitely nervous but overall I felt good.   
The test started and during verbal, I already had a slight feeling that the questions I'm seeing are easier than the ones I'm used to, especially the RC. I finished the section with 9 min left on the clock. Then I  started with quant. I couldn't come up with a solution for the first question, even though I knew it was an easy one. I went through with the section but the questions were so much easier than ever before. After  finishing that section I was already worried that I probably didn't get  the 600 again but when I saw my result later I was more than shocked:  
530 (Q:31 V:32).   
I couldn't believe my eyes.   
I  have no clue what went so horribly wrong that day but I have to find out asap. I only got one more chance to retake in about 3 weeks to get the score on time and I really don't know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could do to improve?  
I bought the  enhanced score report and you could tell that I was doing badly overall,  but what stood out to me were the following insights:  
 verbal sub section rankings:   
CR 78th - Analysis/critique 66% / Construction/Plan 100%  
RC 9th (????? I felt like all my RC's on the test were way too easy) - Identify Inferred Idea 60%/ Identify stated idea 40%   
SC 72nd - Grammar 57%/ communication 100%  
 the first quart,er I had only 50% of the questions correct, in the last 88%  
 quant:

Value/Order/Factors 54%  
Equal./Inequal./Alg. 80%  
Counting/sets/series 100%

I am almost finished with the two books, and I wanted to know what other resources I could make use of for practice on CR? I have also been using Veritas Question Bank for CR for the past few days.

After that I also wanted to know if its wise to purchase that practice question set on GMAT's website for $30 and if those practice questions have any overlap with the GMAT OG and the Official Verbal and Quant Guides. Basically I want more practice for CR, but not sure which resources to lean towards after I've done all the 120 in the OG from 2012.

0,"Hi Everyone,  thought I'd share my approach to verbal as I was able to see a huge improvement from my diagnostic to my first practice test after prepping. **Hoping this helps some of you who may be struggling with a particular section or with identifying a tactical strategy/approach to verbal.** 2020 Diagnostic 29V**   
**May 2020 PT 45V** disclosure, I took the LSAT 2 years ago, and while I forgot most concepts, I still remembered my study approach. When I began prepping for the GMAT, I did my best to follow GMAT best practices but realized it just wasn't working for me. This was my approach instead:  
If you're struggling with RC or are having trouble remembering the core of the story/argument, I recommend the memory method from 7sage located [here](  
The main takeaway to remember is to identify the main point and the structure of the passage rather than granular details. Create a map on your scratch paper so you can quickly refer back to the passage for relevant details. For ex:   
P1. intro of problem/theory   
P2. counterpoint or new theory/ author position   
P3. conclusion x /author main idea, etc.   
I also notate major dates or definition location of a topic/term from the prompt for quick reference.   
What works for me is to read the question first before reading the prompt. This way I know exactly what to look for. I recommend doing this only after you learn GMAT question types. Once you understand what they are looking for it helps to read the Q first so you immediately read the prompt with the right mindset. For example, ""which of the following will weaken the argument"" I'll read the prompt looking for structural flaws to the argument essentially ready to debate the author.  
***Strategic drills are key*** \- once you learn a concept begin practicing it immediately. My biggest critique of Manhattan's guide is that there aren't real practice questions to work with after each section. (Probably why it's called a guide)  
My first mistake was to fly through each chapter and complete only the questions at the end. I never took the time to really implement the chapter's lesson. After realizing my gaps, I went back and reviewed each chapter then created a set of drills, 10 Q max using real OG questions. You can go [here]( to find each question type you are looking for. I only chose 10 each time so I took the time to really dissect each question. I would ask myself the following:  
\-Why is the right answer right?  
\-Why are the wrong answers wrong?  
\-What did I miss seeing?  
\-What should I look for next time? this was helpful because I began to identify patterns relevant to the question type. Parallelism markers, traps, modifier errors, subject-verb agreement issues in dense sentences. After a while it becomes intuitive and you can trust your mental guide to identify trap answers, and confidently choose the right one without relying on your ""ear"". hope this helps!",GMAT Verbal Prep Strategy,1589411308,4,583,1

0,"This forum has always been very helpful to me, so wanted to take a minute to outline my study plan. First, in states that have opened up, you may take the test in person w/the traditional format. I took mine on May 5. context, I received a 650 on Practice Test 1 from the official site and have always been a good test taker (99th percentile on ACT/SAT in high school). start, I noticed my math score was a bit on the lower end, largely due to unfamiliarity with DS questions and having forgotten many basic geometry concepts. So, I started out by reviewing the entire Manhattan Quant book in detail. I reviewed the Erica Meltzer sentence correction book twice from cover to cover, doing all the suggested practice problems and in book exercises. this time, I also continued to refer to the GMATClub forum to be aware of ""C-trap"" questions on DS, and other tricky questions that can lead to silly mistakes. I took a real test (about 3 weeks after starting prep) and received a 720 (50Q, V38). Felt meh about this score, and decided to hone in on Verbal. started by doing every question from GMAC (the big book, verbal review, quant review, and advanced questions). When I noticed I was getting about 90-95% of the questions right, I began to take practice tests. took all 5 other practice tests and got between 750-770 on all of them.

0,"Hi r/gmat! a new account to share with this community my insights now that I've completed my GMAT journey.  began studying as a New Year's Resolution on January 1st and took the exam last Saturday. While I was home for the holidays, I spent time researching which resources are the best, and that was when I first started ""lurking"" on r/gmat. I saw all of the praise for Target Test Prep for quant, and I made a note to try the free trial if I felt I needed help there. For verbal/AWA/IR, because back then TTP did not have a verbal option, I decided to follow the advice of many on here who recommended the Official Guide from GMAC.  thing I did was the diagnostic test in the front of the Official Guide, and using a conversion scale I got somewhere between a 630 and 660, though full disclosure I was exhausted from a full 10 hours of work and my dog interrupted me several times. However I still was able to see that my weakest area was in quant despite my full-time job being in a quantitative discipline. So I tried the free trial for Target Test Prep. immediately I liked the format. I've always been someone who has better short-term memory than long-term, which generally makes me a good tester, but with the exhaustive material tested on the GMAT the reintroduction of previous concepts each chapter with TTP greatly helped me. I found myself improving my score early on, and my first mock test 3 weeks later showed that.  like so many in this community, my test was cancelled and I was subject to the choice of either 1. take the online alternative, or 2. wait it out and hope testing centers open before application season starts (I am planning on applying this fall). Knowing the marginal returns from studying would diminish if I waited too long, I bit the bullet and signed up for the online GMAT.  experience with the online GMAT was tame compared to some of the reviews I have seen on here. I did not have to wait for a proctor (in fact my test started 15 minutes early), I was never communicated with, and I never had any glitches with the whiteboard. However, I can still attest to the challenges associated with the whiteboard. I can say for certain there are two questions I answered incorrectly due to the whiteboard adding too much time. I drew with my mouse and did not use the keyboard at all. Turning down the settings for the mouse slightly so it was a little easier to write but not too slow, I was able to get by for the most part. If you have time to practice (I did 30 practice quant questions every night before my exam using the Manhattan Prep Online Whiteboard) I would recommend this, because the keyboard makes anything with fractions and exponents a nightmare. I still score in line with my best mock tests, and I owe it to practicing with the online whiteboard and Target Test Prep. I have since recommended Target Test Prep to several of my friends who have just began studying during quarantine, and to anyone reading this who is looking for advice on how to improve your quant score, I sincerely suggest at least trying the free trial to determine if the format fits you. 720 (Q: 47, V: 42, IR: 8) (retook as a 7th, 780, Q: 50, V: 47, IR: 8)

I am keeping an error log there and later on, I plan to get back to the wrong questions again. My accuracy is 70% in PS and 80% in DS. target score is 720.
